# This step runs any FATs which declare that they test the 'checkpoint' feature in an environment with CRIU installed.
# Checkpoint FATs therefore run twice in builds but the @CheckpointTest annotation and use of the fat.test.run.checkpoint.only property mean that in CRIU environments
# they only run the test cases with @CheckpointTest (skipping the others) and in non-CRIU environments they only run the unannotated test cases. Hence, there's no duplication of testing.
