# Delete this section and fill in the remaining info from the template

ATTENTION, READ THIS: Updated July 2024 

Read and understand this completely, then delete the static part of the template. 

If a reviewer or merger sees this template, they should fail the review or merge.

If this code change is fixing a user-visible bug in previously released code, it MUST
have an associated issue **mentioned in the PR text or description**.  
 
   - That Issue also MUST be labelled “release bug”

     This directs automation to scrape this fix for inclusion in the next release's
     list of bugs fixed.

   - The linkage between PR and Issue should use the `Fixes #...` syntax rather than a manual
     link via the Development widget.

Otherwise, a link to an issue or specific issue labels are optional.
