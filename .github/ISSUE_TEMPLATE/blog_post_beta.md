The information you provide here will be included in the Open Liberty beta blog post ([example](https://openliberty.io/blog/2020/08/05/jakarta-grpc-beta-20009.html)), which will be published on the OpenLiberty.io blog, and potentially elsewhere, to promote this beta of Open Liberty.

Please provide the following information the week before the GA/beta date (to allow for review and publishing):

1. Which Liberty feature does your update relate to?
    
   Human-readable name (eg WebSockets feature):
   
   Feature name (eg websockets-1.0): 

2. Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations.

3. Write a paragraph to summarises the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
   
   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?

## What happens next?

- Your paragraph will be included in the beta blog post. It might be edited for style and consistency.
- You will be asked to review a draft before publication.
- If you would _also_ like to write a standalone blog post about your update (highly recommended), raise an issue on the [Open Liberty blogs repo](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/blogs/issues/new/choose). State in the issue that the blog post relates to a specific release so that we can ensure it is published on an appropriate date (it won't be the same day as the beta blog post).
