The information you provide here will be included in the Open Liberty beta blog post ([example](https://openliberty.io/blog/2020/08/05/jakarta-grpc-beta-20009.html)), which will be published on [openliberty.io/blog/](https://www.openliberty.io/blog/), and potentially elsewhere, to promote this beta feature/function of Open Liberty. For this post to be included in the beta issue please make sure that this is completed by the end of Friday following the GM (Tuesday). The beta and release blogs are created using automation and rely on you following the template's structure. **DO NOT REMOVE/ALTER THE `<GHA>` TAGS THROUGHOUT THIS TEMPLATE.**

Please provide the following information:

## What happens next?
- Add the label for the beta you're targeting: `target:YY00X-beta`.
- Make sure this blog post is linked back to the Epic for this feature/function.
- Your paragraph will be included in the beta blog post. It might be edited for style and consistency.
- You will be asked to review a draft before publication.
    - Once you've approved the code review, close this issue. 
- If you would _also_ like to write a standalone blog post about your update (highly recommended), raise an issue on the [Open Liberty blogs repo](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/blogs/issues/new/choose). State in the issue that the blog post relates to a specific release so that we can ensure it is published on an appropriate date (it won't be the same day as the beta blog post).
