#   Strings in this file which contain replacement variables are processed by the MessageFormat

# All messages must use the range CWWCK1400 to CWWCK1499

CWWKC1400.unsupported.return.type=CWWKC1400E: {0} is not a valid return type for the {1} method of the {2} class. Valid return types for methods that are annotated with {3} are: {4}.
CWWKC1400.unsupported.return.type.explanation=The Jakarta concurrency specification limits the range of valid return types for methods that have this annotation.
CWWKC1400.unsupported.return.type.useraction=Update the method within the application to switch to one of the supported return types, or remove the annotation from the method.

CWWKC1401.class.anno.disallowed=CWWKC1401E: The {0} annotation is allowed at the method level. It cannot be used at the class level on the {1} class.
CWWKC1401.class.anno.disallowed.explanation=This annotation must not be specified at the class level.
CWWKC1401.class.anno.disallowed.useraction=Move the annotation to the individual methods of the class.

CWWKC1402.not.managed.executor=CWWKC1402E: The {0} annotation on the {1} method of the {2} class specifies the {3} JNDI name, which resolves to the {4} resource which is not a ManagedExecutorService or ManagedScheduledExecutorService. Interfaces implemented by the resource are: {5}.
CWWKC1402.not.managed.executor.explanation=The JNDI name must resolve to a resource that implements the ManagedExecutorService interface or ManagedScheduledExecutorService interface.
CWWKC1402.not.managed.executor.useraction=Correct the JNDI name to specify a resource that is accessible to the application component and implements the ManagedExecutorService interface or ManagedScheduledExecutorService interface.

CWWKC1403.unsupported.tx.type=CWWKC1403E: The {0} annotation specifies the {1} value, which is not permitted in combination with the {2} annotation that is on the {3} method of the {4} class. Permitted values are: {5}.
CWWKC1403.unsupported.tx.type.explanation=The use of two annotations together depends on whether the value of the first annotation that is specified is permitted with the second annotation.
CWWKC1403.unsupported.tx.type.useraction=Update the application to switch to one of the supported values or remove one of the annotations.
