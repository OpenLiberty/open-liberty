#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Unable to determine the generic type of the ConfigValue to be injected at "{0}".
unable.to.determine.injection.type.CWMCG5001E=CWMCG5001E: Unable to determine the type of the property to be injected. The type of the injection point was "{0}".
unable.to.determine.injection.type.CWMCG5001E.explanation=The injection point annotated with the @ConfigProperty qualifier did not have a valid type.
unable.to.determine.injection.type.CWMCG5001E.useraction=Ensure that the injection point has a valid type for the property you wish to inject.

# The property name must be specified for Constructor and Method configuration property injection.
unable.to.determine.injection.name.CWMCG5002E=CWMCG5002E: The property name must be specified for Constructor and Method configuration property injection.
unable.to.determine.injection.name.CWMCG5002E.explanation=It is not possible to derive the default property name for the Constructors and Method parameters. The correct property name must be passed to the @ConfigProperty qualifier. 
unable.to.determine.injection.name.CWMCG5002E.useraction=Set the correct property name using the @ConfigProperty qualifier.

# InjectionPoint dependency could not be resolved: {0}. The exception is {1}.
unable.to.resolve.injection.point.CWMCG5003E=CWMCG5003E: The {0} InjectionPoint dependency was not resolved. Error: {1}
unable.to.resolve.injection.point.CWMCG5003E.explanation=An injected Config Property did not resolve. Either the named property could not be found or a Converter for the required type did not resolve. 
unable.to.resolve.injection.point.CWMCG5003E.useraction=Check the server message and ffdc logs to determine the cause. Ensure that the property exists in one of the Config Sources and that the required Converters have been configured.

# The configuration property named "{0}" was not found.
property.not.found.CWMCG5004E=CWMCG5004E: The "{0}" configuration property was not found.
property.not.found.CWMCG5004E.explanation=The named property was not found in any of the configured sources. 
property.not.found.CWMCG5004E.useraction=Ensure that the property exists in one of the Config Sources.

The InjectionPoint dependency was not resolved for the Observer method: {0}. Error: {1}.
unable.to.resolve.observer.injection.point.CWMCG5005E=CWMCG5005E: The InjectionPoint dependency was not resolved for the Observer method: {0}. Error: {1}.
unable.to.resolve.observer.injection.point.CWMCG5005E.explanation=An injected ConfigProperty did not resolve. Either the named property was not able to be found or a Converter for the required type did not resolve. 
unable.to.resolve.observer.injection.point.CWMCG5005E.useraction=Check the server message and FFDC logs to determine the cause. Ensure that the property exists in one of the ConfigSources and that the required Converters were configured.

unable.to.process.observer.injection.point.CWMCG5006E=CWMCG5006E: The InjectionPoint dependency was not processed for the Observer bean: {0}.
unable.to.process.observer.injection.point.CWMCG5006E.explanation=An unknown error occurred. It was not possible to properly process an Observer method.
unable.to.process.observer.injection.point.CWMCG5006E.useraction=Check the server message and FFDC logs to determine the cause.
