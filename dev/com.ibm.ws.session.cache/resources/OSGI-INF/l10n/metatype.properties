httpSessionCache=HTTP Session Cache
httpSessionCache.desc=Controls how HTTP sessions are persisted using JCache.

libraryRef=Shared Library
libraryRef.desc=Identifies JCache provider files.

uri=JCache configuration URI
uri.desc=Vendor specific JCache configuration URI, which is passed to the JCache provider when obtaining the CacheManager.

properties=JCache Configuration Properties
properties.desc=List of vendor specific JCache configuration properties, which are passed to the JCache provider when obtaining the CacheManager.

extraProperties.name=Vendor specific properties
extraProperties.description=List of vendor specific JCache configuration properties, which are passed to the JCache provider when obtaining the CacheManager.

# performance group properties:

performance.name=Performance
performance.description=Use these properties to tune performance.

scheduleInval1=First hour of scheduled invalidation
scheduleInval2=Second hour of scheduled invalidation
scheduleInval.desc=Enable this option to reduce the number of cache updates required to remove invalidated HTTP sessions. Specify an hour of the day when there is the least activity. When this option is disabled, the invalidator process runs every few minutes to remove invalidated HTTP sessions.

writeContents=Write contents
writeContents.desc=Specifies which session data is written to the persistent store.
writeContents.set=Only attributes for which setAttribute is invoked are written to the persistent store.
writeContents.getset=Attributes for which getAttribute or setAttribute is invoked are written to the persistent store. This can be useful for applications that use getAttribute to obtain and mutate attribute values without using setAttribute to explicitly request that they be written to the persistent store.
writeContents.all=All attributes are written to the persistent store regardless of whether getAttribute or setAttribute are invoked.

writeFrequency=Write frequency
writeFrequency.desc=Specifies when session data is written to the persistent store.
writeFrequency.es=Session data is written to the persistent store after the servlet completes execution.
writeFrequency.mu=Session data is written to the persistent store upon programmatic sync of the IBMSession object.
writeFrequency.tb=Session data is written to the persistent store according to the write interval.

writeInterval=Write interval
writeInterval.desc=Specifies how often to write session data to the persistent store. This value is used when a time-based write frequency is enabled.
