J2CA7001.adapter.install.successful.useraction=No action is required.

# replaces APPLICATION_START_FAILED
J2CA7002.adapter.install.failed=J2CA7002E: An exception occurred while installing the resource adapter {0}. The exception message is: {1}

J2CA7012.adapter.not.installed.explanation=The resource adapter could not be installed because of earlier errors. 
J2CA7012.adapter.not.installed.useraction=Check the resource adapter configuration and check the logs for errors during the resource adapter install.

# replaces DUPLICATE_APPLICATION_NAME
J2CA7013.duplicate.adapter.name=J2CA7013E: It is not possible to install multiple resource adapters or other artifacts called {0}.
J2CA7013.duplicate.adapter.name.explanation=The resource adapter name must be unique.  This might be because multiple resource adapters or other artifacts have been configured to have the same name, or a single resource adapter has been deployed both by configuration in the server.xml file and by putting the resource adapter in the dropins directory.
J2CA7013.duplicate.adapter.name.useraction=If multiple resource adapters or other artifacts have the same name, remove or rename one of them. If a single resource adapter has been deployed in two different ways, change the configuration so that only one deployment method is used.

# replaces APPLICATION_NOT_FOUND
J2CA7014.adapter.not.found=J2CA7014W: The resource adapter {0} could not be installed as it could not be found at location {1}.
J2CA7014.adapter.not.found.explanation=The server could not find the resource adapter at the specified location (or relative locations if it was a relative path).
J2CA7014.adapter.not.found.useraction=Check that the location defined is correct for the resource adapter.

# replaces STARTING_APPLICATION

J2CA7022.adapter.slow.install.explanation=The resource adapter did not install in the expected time. This could be because the server is overloaded or the resource adapter is large. If the resource adapter is installing as part of server startup, the server startup will finish without waiting for the resource adapter to install.
