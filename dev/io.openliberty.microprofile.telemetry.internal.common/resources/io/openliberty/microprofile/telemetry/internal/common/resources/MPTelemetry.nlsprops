CWMOT5100.tracing.is.disabled=CWMOT5100I: The MicroProfile Telemetry Tracing feature is enabled but not configured to generate traces for the {0} application.
CWMOT5100.tracing.is.disabled.explanation=The MicroProfile Telemetry Tracing feature needs to be configured to create traces and export them to a tracing system.
CWMOT5100.tracing.is.disabled.useraction=To enable tracing, specify otel.sdk.disabled=false in any of the configuration sources accessible through MicroProfile Config. Further configuration might be required to allow the MicroProfile Telemetry Tracing feature to export traces to your tracing system.

CWMOT5000.cannot.get.globalopentelemetry=CWMOT5000W: The GlobalOpenTelemetry.get method was called. This method returns a non-functional OpenTelemetry object. Use CDI to inject an OpenTelemetry object instead.
CWMOT5000.cannot.get.globalopentelemetry.explanation=The GlobalOpenTelemetry class is not supported because no global OpenTelemetry object exists. Instead, each application must use CDI to inject the OpenTelemetry object for that application.
CWMOT5000.cannot.get.globalopentelemetry.useraction=Use CDI to inject the OpenTelemetry object.

CWMOT5001.cannot.set.globalopentelemetry=CWMOT5001E: Setting the GlobalOpenTelemetry object is not supported.
CWMOT5001.cannot.set.globalopentelemetry.explanation=The GlobalOpenTelemetry class is not supported because no global OpenTelemetry object exists. Instead, each application must use CDI to inject the OpenTelemetry object for that application.
CWMOT5001.cannot.set.globalopentelemetry.useraction=Do not call the GlobalOpenTelemetry.get method. Where the application code needs to obtain an OpenTelemetry object, use CDI to inject it.

CWMOT5002.telemetry.error=CWMOT5002E: An internal error occurred in MicroProfile Telemetry. The error is: {0}.
CWMOT5002.telemetry.error.explanation=An error occurred that prevented the normal operation of MicroProfile Telemetry.
CWMOT5002.telemetry.error.useraction=Review the server message.log file and FFDC logs to identify the problem.

CWMOT5003.factory.used.after.shutdown=CWMOT5003W: The {0} application  attempted to acquire MicroProfile Telemetry after the application shut down.
CWMOT5003.factory.used.after.shutdown.explanation=CWMOT5003.factory.used.after.shutdown.explanation=After an application shuts down, MicroProfile Telemetry returns objects that silently perform no-op actions when they are invoked. This process might lead to the absence of expected telemetry data.
CWMOT5003.factory.used.after.shutdown.useraction=Review the application to see why it attempted to use MicroProfile Telemetry after  shutting down. Actions that can trigger the use of MicroProfile Telemetry include calling a method that is annotated with @WithSpan or making a request with a JAX-RS Client or MP Rest Client.

CWMOT5004.factory.used.without.metadata=CWMOT5004W: A request was made for an OpenTelemetry object but no application metadata, and no global OpenTelemetry object was available. 
CWMOT5004.factory.used.without.metadata.explanation=CWMOT5004.factory.used.without.metadata.explanation=If there is no global OpenTelemetry object Liberty's MicroProfile Telemetry integration code will attempt to find the correct OpenTelemetry object for the current application by using the application metadata on the current thread. However as there was no metadata on the thread it was unable to do so. 
CWMOT5004.factory.used.without.metadata.useraction=Review your code to see why the integration code attempted to use MicroProfile Telemetry without metadata and a server scoped OpenTelemetry object. The integration code most likely tries to create new threads without using the ManagedExecutorService interface and to acquire an OpenTelemetry object from within the application. To acquire an OpenTemetry object outside of an application, enable OpenTelemetry through an environment variable or a system property.

CWMOT5005.mptelemetry.unknown.log.source=CWMOT5005W: The MicroProfile Telemetry logging feature does not recognize the [ {0} ] log source.
CWMOT5005.mptelemetry.unknown.log.source.explanation=The Liberty runtime environment does not provide the specified log source.
CWMOT5005.mptelemetry.unknown.log.source.useraction=Check the configuration information and specify one of the supported sources for MicroProfile Telemetry.
