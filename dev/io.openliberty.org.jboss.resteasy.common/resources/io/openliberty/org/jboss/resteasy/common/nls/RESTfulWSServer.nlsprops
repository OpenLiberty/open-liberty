MULTIPLE_REST_SERVLETS_CWWKW1300W.explanation=Only one REST servlet is allowed to be defined per web module. A REST servlet is any servlet that uses one of the following class names: com.ibm.websphere.jaxrs.server.IBMRestServlet, org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.HttpServletDispatcher, or org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.HttpServlet30Dispatcher. This message indicates that more than one servlet is specified either in the web.xml or configured dynamically.
