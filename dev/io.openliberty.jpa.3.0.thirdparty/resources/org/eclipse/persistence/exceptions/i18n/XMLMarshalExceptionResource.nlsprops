25001=Invalid XPath string: {0}

25002=An integer index could not be parsed from this XPath string: {0}

25003=An error occurred marshalling the object

25004=An error occurred unmarshalling the document

25005=An error occurred validating the object

25006=A default root element was not specified for the XMLDescriptor mapped to {0}

25007=A descriptor for class {0} was not found in the project.  For JAXB, if the JAXBContext was bootstrapped using TypeMappingInfo[] you must call a marshal method that accepts TypeMappingInfo as an input parameter.

25008=A descriptor with default root element {0} was not found in the project

25010=A schema reference was not specified for the XMLDescriptor mapped to {0}

25011=A null argument was encountered

25012=An error occurred resolving the XML Schema.

25013=An error occurred while trying to set the schemas.

25014=An error occurred while trying to instantiate the schema platform.

25015=An error occurred trying to resolve the namespace URI for {0}. A namespace resolver was not specified on the descriptor.

25016=A namespace for the prefix {0} was not found in the namespace resolver.

25017=Either enumClass or enumClassName must be set on the JAXBTypesafeEnumConverter.

25018=The fromString method on the enum class {0} does not exist or could not be invoked.

25019=The specified enum class {0} could not be found.

25020=The method "getResult()" must not be called before the "endDocument()" event has been called.

25021=Class {0} invalid for SwaRef. Must be javax.activation.DataHandler.

25022=Unable to marshal Image. No encoder available for mimeType {0}.

25023=No descriptor found while unmarshalling element mapped to attribute {0}.

25024=An error occurred instantiating the UnmappedContentHandler class {0}.

25025=The UnmappedContentHandler class {0} set on the XMLUnmarshaller must implement org.eclipse.persistence.oxm.unmapped.UnmappedContentHandler.

25026=Unable to update node [{0}], object not found in cache.

25027=Unable to retrieve attachment with cid {0} because no AttachmentUnmarshaller was set.

25028=No reference descriptor found for mapping {1} due to an unknown xsi:type value: {0}.

25029=For the prefix [{0}] class [{1}] attempted to assign the namespace URI [{2}], but its parent class [{3}] has already assigned the namespace URI [{4}].

25030=An error occurred while invoking the {0} method on the custom NamespacePrefixMapper: {1}.

25031=An error occurred while processing the namespace prefix mapper: {1}. The method {0} was not found.

25032=An error occurred while invoking the {0} method on the custom CharacterEscapeHandler: {1}.

25033=An error occurred while processing the CharacterEscapeHandler: {1}. The method {0} was not found.

25034=An error occurred while invoking the {0} method on the custom IDResolver: {1}.

25035=An error occurred while processing the IDResolver: {1}. The method {0} was not found.

25036=The custom IDResolver {1} does not support multiple XML IDs {0}.  Custom IDResolvers must be subclasses org.eclipse.persistence.jaxb.IDResolver if multiple IDs are used.

25037=A cycle is detected in the object graph.  This will cause an infinite loop: {0}

25038=DOMPlatform is not supported with media type application/json.

25039=An error occurred unmarshalling from {0}

25040=An object of type {0} with ID {1} was not found.

25041=The attribute group specified {0} is not defined for the class {1}.

25042=The value of the variable property {0} on the class {1} can not be null.
