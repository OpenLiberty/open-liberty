*** XML Signing & Validation README ***
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The config bundle supports a mode designed for embedded users of Liberty where all configuration
documents are checked for valid XML signatures before parsing. This mode is enabled via the bundle
fragment com.ibm.ws.ext_1.0.jar containing com.ibm.ws.config.ext.ConfigExtension, which by default
is set up to use the "default" config validation, which is to not validate at all. 

By removing the class from the bundle fragment, building an alternate copy of the class with 
defaultConfigValidation = false, or setting forceEmbeddedConfigValidation = true at runtime, the
full validation mode is enabled. In full/embedded validation mode, all config documents (server.xml
files and any includes) must contain an XML signature done with a certificate issued by the Liberty
team. Additionally, drop-in applications must be disabled or else the server will not start.
