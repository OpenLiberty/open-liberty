CWWKO1560_VALIDATION_NOT_IMPLEMENTED=CWWKO1560E: Validation is not provided for connection factory {0}, which implements {1}.
CWWKO1560_VALIDATION_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.explanation=Validation is only possible for resource adapter connection factories that are JMS connection factories or implement javax.resource.cci.ConnectionFactory or javax.sql.DataSource.
CWWKO1560_VALIDATION_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.useraction=Do not attempt to validate this type of connection factory.

CWWKO1561_JMS_NOT_ENABLED=CWWKO1561E: The resource adapter requires JMS, but a feature that enables JMS is not present in the server configuration.
CWWKO1561_JMS_NOT_ENABLED.explanation=A feature that enables JMS is required for this configuration element.
CWWKO1561_JMS_NOT_ENABLED.useraction=Include a feature that enables JMS in the server configuration.

CWWKO1562_NO_CONSPEC=CWWKO1562E: Validation cannot be performed with the specified user and password because there is no standard way of locating the proper ConnectionSpec implementation.
CWWKO1562_NO_CONSPEC.explanation=The validation REST endpoint was unable to determine the name of the ConnectionSpec implementation, so it has no way of supplying the specified user name and password to the connection factory.
CWWKO1562_NO_CONSPEC.useraction=Omit the user and password parameters when requesting validation of this connection factory.
