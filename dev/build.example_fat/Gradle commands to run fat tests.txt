To run a fat test use the command 

/gradlew build.example_fat:buildandrun

If you wish to include tests annotated with @Mode(TestMode.FULL) use

/gradlew build.example_fat:buildandrun -Dfat.test.mode=FULL

And if you only want to run a single test class the command is 

./gradlew build.example_fat:buildandrun -Dfat.test.class.name=com.ibm.ws.example.SimpleTest
