# Messages used by FaultTolerance Impl -  range is 0000-4999, plus 9999 for the emergency message
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#A timeout occurred. 
timeout.occurred.CWMFT0000E=CWMFT0000E: A timeout occurred.
timeout.occurred.CWMFT0000E.explanation=An operation took too long to complete for the configured Timeout.
timeout.occurred.CWMFT0000E.useraction=Increase the maximum duration of the Timeout or ensure that the operation completes faster. 

#No free capacity was available in the bulkhead for method {0}.
bulkhead.no.threads.CWMFT0001E=CWMFT0001E: No free capacity is available in the bulkhead for method {0}.
bulkhead.no.threads.CWMFT0001E.explanation=A call to the method did not succeed because the bulkhead for the method is full.
bulkhead.no.threads.CWMFT0001E.useraction=Increase availability in the bulkhead by increasing the capacity of the bulkhead or reducing the concurrent workload of this service.

application.shutdown.CWMFT0002W=CWMFT0002W: The {0} asynchronous method cannot complete because the application or component that called it stopped.
application.shutdown.CWMFT0002W.explanation=Asynchronous methods run in the context of the component that started them. The application or component that called the asynchronous method stopped, which prevented the asynchronous method from completing.
application.shutdown.CWMFT0002W.useraction= This warning usually occurs when an application, component, or server is shutting down. If all running asynchronous methods must complete, then the application or component must wait for the results before stopping.

#The asynchronous method {0} returned null. 
asynchronous.returned.null.CWMFT0003W=CWMFT0003W: The asynchronous method {0} returned null. 
asynchronous.returned.null.CWMFT0003W.explanation=Methods annotated with @Asynchronous must not return a null value.
asynchronous.returned.null.CWMFT0003W.useraction=Prevent a null value from being returned by the method.

#An internal error occurred. The exception is {0}.
internal.error.CWMFT4998E=CWMFT4998E: An internal error occurred. The exception is {0}.
internal.error.CWMFT4998E.explanation=The application server experienced an internal error.
internal.error.CWMFT4998E.useraction=Gather a set of traces and open a new issue against your application server.

#Generic error for internal failures. 
internal.error.CWMFT4999E=CWMFT4999E: An internal error occurred.
internal.error.CWMFT4999E.explanation=The application server experienced an internal error.
internal.error.CWMFT4999E.useraction=Gather a set of traces and open a new issue against your application server.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Emergency FaultTolerance error message
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Fault Tolerance API error has occurred: {0}
temporary.CWMFT9999E=CWMFT9999E: A Fault Tolerance API error has occurred: {0}
temporary.CWMFT9999E.explanation=A Fault Tolerance API error has occurred that prevents normal operation.
temporary.CWMFT9999E.useraction=Review the FFDC logs and exception text to identify the problem.
