/**
 * This FAT bucket tests the websphere.session.*, websphere.datasource.* events
 * that can possibly disrupt the request counts. Same tests from
 * RequestTimingMbeanTest are added to include these event feature and invokes
 * the servlet for specific methods that drive them.
 *
 * Background: The request timing support is intrinsically dependent on the
 * probe framework. The probe framework is a generic mechanism that allows
 * components to register specific methods/events (along the execution path)
 * with it such that those components are called by the probe framework prior
 * and post (registered) method execution. The probe framework calls components
 * through events. Therefore, a registered method is associated to an event and
 * event type. The probe framework is synchronous in nature and treats events
 * (method calls) along the request execution path as parent(root)/children
 * events. The request timing support uses the root/parent event notion to count
 * active, slow, hung, etc requests only once. Each request is counted/tracked
 * per root event type. This means that there can only be one root event type
 * per request type if the counts are to be accurate. For example, the
 * expectation is that request timing tracks all servlet requests under a single
 * root event type called websphere.servlet.service. In this particular case,
 * there is is a method in the servlet request execution path called *service()
 * that was registered with the probe framework and was associated event type
 * websphere.servlet.service. It is this event type that is supposed to
 * represent all servlet requests. Given that the probe support is a generic
 * event framework, the root event and associated event type can change. More
 * precisely, if there is another component that registered method
 * x()/event-type-x with the probe framework, and method x() is along the
 * servlet execution path, which is called before the method associated with
 * event websphere.servlet.service, the request timing counts would now be
 * tracked under method x()'s event type. This exposes a flaw in the way request
 * timing keeps track of request counts. For instance, If there were to be
 * dynamic configuration updates that enabled components that changed what is
 * considered to be the root event, the counts for a request type would be split
 * among different root events. One known case where this takes place is when
 * zosRequestLogging-1.0 is also enabled. The enablement of this feature causes
 * the root event type or servlet request to change from
 * websphere.servlet.service to websphere.http.wrapperHandleAndExecute. The
 * agreed temporary solution is to simply allow the notion that request types
 * can have more than one root event type. This means that when retrieving
 * statistic counts for servlet requests, callers must manually track and add
 * the counts kept under the two potential and currently know root events:
 * websphere.servlet.service and websphere.http.wrapperHandleAndExecute.
 *
 * Notes: - At each servlet request a global variable for total requests is
 * incremented. The total value is checked after each test for consistency.
 * Since the counts are checked from the servlet there will always be 1 active
 * request during the mbean call which happens inside the initial servlet call.
