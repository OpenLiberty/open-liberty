// TODO: This would be nice to remove.  To do that,
//       service references would need to be removed.

// There seem to be three uses of JavaEEVersion:
//
// One, as a service reference.  This seems questionable,
// since the service object is used only to carry properties.
//
// Two, to provide shared definitions of version constants 7.0 and 8.0.
// The sharing benefit seems too small to justify the dependency
// cost.
//
// Third, a definition of the default platform version is provided.
// The utility of the default is questionable, and seems to be
// very out of date.
//
// The class has been simplified to only provide constants of
// known use.
//
// As a TODO, the shared version constants should be removed,
// and an alternate to the default version constant should be
// found.
