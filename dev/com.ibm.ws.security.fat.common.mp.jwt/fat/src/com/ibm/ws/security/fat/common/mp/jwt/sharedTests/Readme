This folder should contain classes that provide common methods for each of the MP Jwt release FATs.
ie:
	There are mp config properties that were supported in 1.1 that are also used and supported in 1.2 and will be supported in future releases.
	The MPJwt11MpConfigTests class contains methods to create/update the 1.1 mp config properties files, env vars and system properties for those attributes/properties.
	The MPJwt12MpConfigTests class contains methods to create/update the 1.2 mp config properties files, env vars and system properties for those attributes/properties.  Those methods
		only work on the 1.2 attributes/properties and then call the 1.1 methods to process the 1.1 properties.
I put these methods in a common project so all future releases can build upon these methods (and metehods like them).
