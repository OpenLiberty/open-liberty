This folder should contain classes that provide common methods for each of the MP Jwt release FATs.
ie:
	There are mpJwt constants that are common to all mpJwt releases.
	There are mpJwt 1.1 constants that extend the common constants.
	There are mpJwt 1.2 constants that extend the 1.1 contants.
	
I put these classes in a common project so all future releases can build upon these classes (and classes like them).
