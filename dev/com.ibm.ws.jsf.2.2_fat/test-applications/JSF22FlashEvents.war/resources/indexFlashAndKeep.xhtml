    <!-- This is initial page for a simple flash request scope call that will subsequently also use the keep keyword.
    A value will be place in the input field and the submit button clicked which will go to page2FlashAndKeep.
    The resulting page will display the value because the flash scope was specified.
    Also, the Flash Events are being called which are being kept track of by messages in the logs.
