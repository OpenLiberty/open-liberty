	<!-- This is a result page for a simple flash request scope call (from indexFlash).
    A value will be place in the output field because the flash keyword is used.
    Also, there is a custom Flash factory and Flash implementation configured for this app.
    In there, we add the class name to the Flash.  We display it here.
    The comandButton click will go to page3 but the value will be lost because the flash scope was specified and the ?faces-redirect=true is used in the action.
    Also, the Flash Events are being called which are being kept track of by messages in the logs.
