	<!-- This is a result page for a simple flash request scope call (from indexFlashAndKeep).
    A value will be place in the output field because the flash keyword is used.
    Also, there is a custom Flash factory and Flash implementation configured for this app.
    In there, we add the class name to the Flash.  We display it here.
    The comandButton click will go to page3 and the value will be kept and displayed even though
    this is a redirect (?faces-redirect=true) because the "keep" keyword is used.
    Also, the Flash Events are being called which are being kept track of by messages in the logs.
