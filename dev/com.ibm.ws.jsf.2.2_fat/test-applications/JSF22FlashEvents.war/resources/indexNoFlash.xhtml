    <!-- This is initial page for a simple request scoped bean call.
    A value will be place in the input field and the submit button clicked which will go to page2NoFlash.
    This commandButton action is coming from the EmployeeBean.  It adds the ?faces-redirect=true which results in the value to be
    lost without the use of Flash.  
    The resulting page will not display the value because the flash keyword was not specified and a request scoped bean was used with a redirect.
    Also, the Flash Events are being called which are being kept track of by messages in the logs.  However, in this scenario, 
    none of the Events should be called as flash is not used.
