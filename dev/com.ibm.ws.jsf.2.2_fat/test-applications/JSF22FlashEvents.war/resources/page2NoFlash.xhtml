	<!-- This is a result page for a simple non-flash request scope call (from indexNoFlash).
    There will not be a value in the output field because the flash keyword was not used and 
    this page came from a redirect (?faces-redirect=true).
    Also, the Flash Events are being called which are being kept track of by messages in the logs,
    however none should be called in this scenario.

       <p>First Name from bean: <h:outputText id="firstName" value="#{employeeBean.firstName}"/></p>
	  <p>this should be empty since it was a request bean with a redirect and no flash.</p>
