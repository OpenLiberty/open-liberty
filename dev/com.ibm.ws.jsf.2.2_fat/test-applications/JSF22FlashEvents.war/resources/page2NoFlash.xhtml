	<!-- This is a result page for a simple non-flash request scope call (from indexNoFlash).
    There will not be a value in the output field because the flash keyword was not used and 
    this page came from a redirect (?faces-redirect=true).
    Also, the Flash Events are being called which are being kept track of by messages in the logs,
    however none should be called in this scenario.
