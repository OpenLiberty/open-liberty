    <!-- This is a simple JSF facelet; it utilizes EL to check if we're currently in a flow.
          If we are in a flow, the currentFlow value should be true.
          The flowScope value is checked to determine if that data is being passed around the flow correctly;
          the flowScope value can be modified via the text input on this page and the "Submit Value" button.
          The back button causes us to exit the flow.

          The primary purpose of this flow is to test that nested flows are functioning correctly, and with multiple configurations.
          This is the second flow in the nested test case.
