        This page tests the behavior of a viewscoped bean in a stateless JSF22 view.  In this case, the view is marked as transient,
        so the timestamp value should change as the following button is clicked.
        <br/><br/>
        <h:form id="button">
            <h:commandButton id="test" value="Generate Timestamp"/>
        </h:form>

        ViewScoped Bean Timestamp:
        <h:outputText id="timestamp" value="#{viewScopedManagedBean.timestamp}"/>
