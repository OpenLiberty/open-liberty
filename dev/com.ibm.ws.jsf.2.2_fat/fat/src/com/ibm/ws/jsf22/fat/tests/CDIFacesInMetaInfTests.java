 * This is one of four CDI test applications, with configuration loaded in the following manner:
 * CDIFacesInMetaInf - META-INF/faces-config.xml
 *
 * We're extending CDITestBase, which has common test code which is found under test-applications/CDICommon.
 *
 * NOTE: These tests should not run with jsf-2.3 feature because constructor injection is not supported.
 * As a result, these tests were modified to run in the JSF 2.3 FAT bucket without constructor injection.
