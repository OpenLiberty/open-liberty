The files in src.gen are generated by the genddmodel target, which uses the
/com.ibm.ws.javaee.ddmetadata/ project to generate the implementation classes
based on source-only annotations on the interface.  If changes are needed, the
generator should be modified, the genddmodel target should be run in all
projects that depend on it, the projects should be refreshed in Eclipse, and the
updated generated files should be checked in.
