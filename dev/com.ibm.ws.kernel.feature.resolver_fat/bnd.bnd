# This FAT tests *all* public features!
#
# The tests are only of feature metadata.  The *function* of the
# features is not tested.
#
# However, from a dependency perspective, this is sufficient to
# mark that the feature is being tested: All features must be
# built and their feature metadata pushed to the server image.
# before running this FAT.
