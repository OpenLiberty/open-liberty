read.write.offset.length.bytearraylength.explanation= Either variable arguments offset was negative, the length was negative, or the length was greater than byte[].length - offset.
read.write.offset.length.bytearraylength.useraction=Modify the application code and verify that the offset value that is provided to read or write API is not negative. Ensure that the length value provided to read API is not negative. Also ensure that the length value provided is greater than byte[] length minus offset value that is provided.

# Notes for translation:
# {0} WriteListener class name
# 
blocking.write.not.allowed=SRVE0918E: The attempted blocking write is not allowed because the non-blocking I/O has already been started by the application registering the WriteListener [{0}].
blocking.write.not.allowed.explanation=The requested blocking write cannot be completed because nonblocking I/O has already started.
blocking.write.not.allowed.useraction=Review the application to determine where the blocking write was performed. For example this could be from a servlet after registering the WriteListener, or from a WriteListener which does a second write after calling the isReady() API. Once the blocking write is determined, change the application to ensure it is performed as part of the WriteListener and/or after calling isReady().
# --------------------------------
# 
# Notes for translation:
# {0} WriteListener class name
# {1} is the Exception String
#
writeListener.onError.failed=SRVE0919E: An exception occurred during the application WriteListener [{0}] onError() API, exception [{1}]
writeListener.onError.failed.explanation= An exception occurred during the application WriteListener onError() API.
writeListener.onError.failed.useraction=Review the logs to determine the exception thrown from the application implementation of onError() API and how to address the problem. Note that if an I/O exception occurred, then the onError() API cannot write output.
