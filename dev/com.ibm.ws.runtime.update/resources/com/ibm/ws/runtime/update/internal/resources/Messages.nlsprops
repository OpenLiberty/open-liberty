quiesce.begin=CWWKE1100I: Waiting for up to {0} seconds for the server to quiesce.
quiesce.begin.explanation=The server waits for services to quiesce before it proceeds with shutdown.
quiesce.begin.useraction=No action is required.

quiesce.end=CWWKE1101I: Server quiesce complete.
quiesce.end.explanation=The quiesce operation completed successfully.
quiesce.end.useraction=No action is required.

quiece.warning=CWWKE1102W: The quiesce operation did not complete. The server will now stop.
quiece.warning.explanation=The process was unable to quiesce all services within the quiesce timeout period.
quiece.warning.useraction=You can safely ignore error messages that are the result of unavailable required services. If the problem persists, increase the 'quiesceTimeout' duration by adding 'quiesceTimeout' attribute to the 'executor' element in the 'server.xml' file.

client.quiesce.begin=CWWKE1103I: Waiting for up to {0} seconds for the client to quiesce.
client.quiesce.begin.explanation=The client waits for services to quiesce before it proceeds with shutdown.
client.quiesce.begin.useraction=No action is required.

client.quiesce.end=CWWKE1104I: Client quiesce complete.
client.quiesce.end.explanation=The quiesce operation completed successfully.
client.quiesce.end.useraction=No action is required.

notifications.not.complete=CWWKE1105W: {0} runtime updates did not complete during the quiesce period. 
notifications.not.complete.explanation=One or more updates to features, configuration, or applications did not complete before the server shutdown.
notifications.not.complete.useraction=No action is required. 

quiesce.listeners.not.complete=CWWKE1106W: {0} shutdown operations did not complete during the quiesce period. 
quiesce.listeners.not.complete.explanation=One or more operations that were initiated during the shutdown operation did not complete. 
quiesce.listeners.not.complete.useraction=No action is required.

quiesce.waiting.on.threads=CWWKE1107W: {0} threads did not complete during the quiesce period. 
quiesce.waiting.on.threads.explanation=One or more threads that were active before shutting down the server were still active at the end of the quiesce period.
quiesce.waiting.on.threads.useraction=No action is required.

quiesce.timeout.not.available=CWWKE1108W: The quiesce timeout value could not be obtained from the ''ApplicationManager''.  The default quiesce timeout value of ''{0}'' is used instead. 
quiesce.timeout.not.available.explanation=The 'RuntimeUpdateMangager' was not able to retrieve the 'quiesceTimeout' value from the 'ApplicationManager'.    
quiesce.timeout.not.available.useraction=Possibly, the 'ApplicationManager' did not start because of a configuration problem. Check the configuration of the 'applicationManager' element in the 'server.xml' file.  Ensure all of the attributes are configured correctly.

quiesce.timeout.too.low=CWWKE1109W: The ''{0}'' value that is specified for the ''quiesceTimeout'' attribute on the ''applicationManager'' element in the ''server.xml'' file is less than the minimum value, which is ''{1}''. The default value of ''{1}'' seconds is used instead.
quiesce.timeout.too.low.explanation=The 'quiesceTimeout' value specifies a duration and accepts values in the format XmXs, where 'X' is replaced by a number,'m' represents minutes, and 's' represents seconds. A value of '1m30s' represents 90 seconds.  
quiesce.timeout.too.low.useraction=Edit the 'server.xml' file and change the 'quiesceTimeout' attribute on the 'applicationManager' element to a valid duration.
