bytebuffer.config=Byte Buffer Management
bytebuffer.config.desc=Defines byte buffer pooling and management settings.

channel.config=Channel Framework
channel.config.desc=Defines channel and chain management settings. 

chfw.chain.start.retry.interval=Chain restart interval
chfw.chain.start.retry.interval.desc=Time interval between start retries.

chfw.chain.start.retry.attempts=Chain restart attempts
chfw.chain.start.retry.attempts.desc=Number of retry attempts to make per chain.

chfw.chain.quiesce.timeout=Quiesce timeout
chfw.chain.quiesce.timeout.desc=Default amount of time to wait while quiescing chains. 

chfw.missing.config.warning=Warning wait time
chfw.missing.config.warning.desc=Amount of time to wait before notifying of a missing factory configuration.

tcp.options=TCP Options
tcp.options.desc=Defines TCP protocol settings.

tcp.soReuseAddr=SO_REUSEADDR socket option
tcp.soReuseAddr.desc=Enables immediate rebind to a port with no active listener.

udp.options=UDP Options
udp.options.desc=Defines UDP protocol settings.

inactivityTimeout=Inactivity timeout
inactivityTimeout.desc=Amount of time to wait for a read or write request to complete on a socket. This value is overridden by protocol-specific timeouts.

tcp.addressIncludeList=Address include list
tcp.addressIncludeList.desc=A comma-separated list of addresses that are allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. You can specify IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. All values in an IPv4 or IPv6 address must be represented by a number or by an asterisk wildcard character.

tcp.addressExcludeList=Address exclude list
tcp.addressExcludeList.desc=A comma-separated list of addresses that are not allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. You can specify IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. All values in an IPv4 or IPv6 address must be represented by a number or by an asterisk wildcard character. 

tcp.hostNameIncludeList=Host name include list
tcp.hostNameIncludeList.desc=A comma-separated list of host names that are allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. Host names are not case-sensitive and can start with an asterisk, which is used as a wildcard character. However, asterisks cannot be elsewhere in the host name. For example, *.abc.com is valid, but *.abc.* is not valid. 

tcp.hostNameExcludeList=Host name exclude list
tcp.hostNameExcludeList.desc=A comma-separated list of host names that are not allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. Host names are not case-sensitive and can start with an asterisk, which is used as a wildcard character. However, asterisks cannot be elsewhere in the host name. For example, *.abc.com is valid, but *.abc.* is not valid.

tcp.acceptThread=Accept thread
tcp.acceptThread.desc=If true, then listening ports do not share the same thread for accepting connections. Otherwise, they share the same thread.

tcp.waitToAccept=Wait to accept
tcp.waitToAccept.desc=Queries whether this TCP Channel will delay accepting connections until the server starts. If false, connections are closed until the server starts. If true, the value for the acceptThread tcpOption is also set to true, and connections are delayed until the server starts.

tcp.maxOpenConnections=Max open connections
tcp.maxOpenConnections.desc=Defines the maximum number of connections allowed to be open on this endpoint.
