   and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

   "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
   the copyright owner that is granting the License.

   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and 
distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document. 

"Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the 
copyright owner that is granting the License. 

"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other 
entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control 
with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means 
(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management 
of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of 
fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) 
beneficial ownership of such entity. 

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising 
permissions granted by this License. 

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, 
including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, 
and configuration files. 

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical 
transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not 
limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and 
conversions to other media types. 

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object 
form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright 
notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is 
provided in the Appendix below). 

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object 
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the 
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications 
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes 
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain 
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, 
the Work and Derivative Works thereof. 

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original 
version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor 
for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or 
Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For 
the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of 
electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its 
representatives, including but not limited to communication on

tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for 
the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding 
communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in 
writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution." 

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on 
behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and 
subsequently incorporated within the Work. 

2. Grant of Copyright License. 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor 
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, 
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare 
Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and 
distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. 

3. Grant of Patent License. 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor 
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, 
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent 
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and 
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those 
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily 
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the 
Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct 
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to 
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to 
contributions by an individual employed by an institution or 
organization is limited to patent claims where the individual that is 
the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent claims 
licensed, and where the organization or institution has the right to 
grant such license under applicable grant and research funding 
agreements. No other express or implied licenses are granted. 

4. Redistribution. 

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works 
thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or 
Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions: 

1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a 
   copy of this License; and 

2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
   that You changed the files; and 

3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You 
   distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices 
   from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not 
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and 

4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 
   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include 
   a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE 
   file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
   Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a 
   NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the 
   Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
   Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the 
   NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
   License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 
   Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE 
   text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices 
   cannot be construed as modifying the License. 

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may 
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, 
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such 
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and 
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated 
in this License. 

5. Submission of Contributions. 

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally 
submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be 
under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional 
terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may 
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 

6. Trademarks. 

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, 
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as 
required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of 
the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. 

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor 
provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on 
an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or 
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks 
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 

8. Limitation of Liability. 

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including 
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law 
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, 
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any 
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss 
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and 
all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has 
been advised of the possibility of such damages. 

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. 

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may 
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with 
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only 
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any 
other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold 
each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims 
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such 
warranty or additional liability.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are 
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to 
make sure the software is free for all its users. 

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some 
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free 
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use 
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this 
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to 
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. 

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not 
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if 
you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in 
new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these 
things. 

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these 
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you 
if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. 

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or 
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. 
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. 
If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete 
object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the 
library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you 
must show them these terms so they know their rights. 

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the 
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal 
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. 

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is 
no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by 
someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they 
have is not the original version, so that the original author's 
reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by 
others. 

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any 
free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively 
restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license 
from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license 
obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full 
freedom of use specified in this license. 

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary 
GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public 
License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different 
from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for 
certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into 
non-free programs. 

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a 
shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a 
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary 
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire 
combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public 
License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the 
library. 

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does 
Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public 
License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an 
advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the 
reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. 
However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special 
circumstances. 

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to 
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it 
becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be 
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library 
does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there 
is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so 
we use the Lesser General Public License. 

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free 
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free 
software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free 
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, 
as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. 

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the 
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked 
with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program 
using a modified version of the Library. 

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a 
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The 
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must 
be combined with the library in order to run. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR 
COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other 
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other 
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this 
Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each 
licensee is addressed as "you". 

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data 
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs 
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. 

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which 
has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" 
means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: 
that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either 
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into 
another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without 
limitation in the term "modification".) 

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the 
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
installation of the library. 

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running 
a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a 
program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing 
it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the 
program that uses the Library does. 

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete 
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices 
that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and 
distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. 

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 


2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of 
it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute 
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided 
that you also meet all of these conditions: 

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices 
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge 
       to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a 
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses 
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility 
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure 
       that, in the event an application does not supply such function 
       or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part 
       of its purpose remains meaningful.

      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has 
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the 
      application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
      application-supplied function or table used by this function must 
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square 
      root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and 
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on 
the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this 
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Library. 

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library 
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a 
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the 
scope of this License. 

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public 
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do 
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that 
they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, 
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the 
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify 
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these 
notices. 

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that 
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all 
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. 

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the 
Library into a program that is not a library. 

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative 
of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the 
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the 
complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be 
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange. 

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the 
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the 
source along with the object code. 

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, 
but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked 
with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in 
isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls 
outside the scope of this License. 

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates 
an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains 
portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". 
The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states 
terms for distribution of such executables. 

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file 
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a 
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. 
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked 
without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold 
for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. 

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure 
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten 
lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is 
unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. 
(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library 
will still fall under Section 6.) 

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may 
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. 
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether 
or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a 
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work 
containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms 
of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work 
for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such 
modifications. 

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the 
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by 
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during 
execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright 
notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the 
user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: 


    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
       machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
       changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that 
       uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the 
       user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified 
       executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood 
       that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in 
       the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
       application to use the modified definitions.)
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the 
       Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a 
       copy of the library already present on the user's computer 
       system, rather than copying library functions into the 
       executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version 
       of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
       version is interface-compatible with the version that the work 
       was made with.
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three 
       years, to give the same user the materials specified in 
       Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of 
       performing this distribution.
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy 
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the 
       above specified materials from the same place.
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these 
       materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" 
must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the 
executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be 
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, 
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, 
unless that component itself accompanies the executable. 

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions 
of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the 
operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them 
and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities 
not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, 
provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library 
and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided 
that you do these two things: 

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based 
       on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. 
       This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that 
       part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where 
       to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the 
Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the 
Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this 
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you 
under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as 
such parties remain in full compliance. 

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the 
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all 
its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the 
Library or works based on it. 

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the 
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library 
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further 
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with 
this License. 

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute 
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and 
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not 
distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would 
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who 
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
distribution of the Library. 

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances. 

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented 
by public license practices. Many people have made generous 
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that 
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to 
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute 
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice. 

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be 
a consequence of the rest of this License. 

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may 
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those 
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries 
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the 
limitation as if written in the body of this License. 

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new 
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may 
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. 

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
later version", you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license 
version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free 
Software Foundation. 

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, 
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is 
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software 
Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be 
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives 
of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software 
generally. 

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO 
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR 
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE 
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH 
YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY 
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR 
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY 
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF 
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR 
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

NOTE: MANUAL CORRECTION REQUIRED - READ AND DELETE TEXT BELOW!!

This entry is for packages licensed as Ruby without SLC disclaimer

There are various versions of the Ruby License that have been 
used, but, unfortunately, the license author didn't assign version 
numbers to the extent that IBM legal are aware. In addition to minor 
wording differences which should not impact on IBM's use of Ruby 
licensed software, some versions include a specific disclaimer that 
there are separately licensed components in the RUBY package, and refer 
the user to a "LEGAL" or another file for details. For ALL Ruby 
versions, regardless of whether the license specifically mentions 
separately licensed code, you should check the LEGAL or other named file 
to ensure that you have identified all relevant licenses for the code 
you are distributing. 

If you are distributing the code in source code form, include a copy of 
the Ruby license (two examples are included in extra_licenses. 
Otherwise, there is no need to include a copy of the license - you can 
delete all text following the list of packages above, leaving the END OF 
RUBY LICENSE NOTICES statement intact.
