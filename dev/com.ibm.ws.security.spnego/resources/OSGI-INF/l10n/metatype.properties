spnego.conf=Spnego Authentication
spnego.conf.desc=Controls the operation of the Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism. 

allowLocalHost=Allow local host request
allowLocalHost.desc=Specifies whether the local host request URL is allowed.

hostName=The fully-qualified host name of the Liberty server
hostName.desc=Specifies the fully-qualified host name of the Liberty server which will form the Kerberos service principal name (SPN) that is used by SPNEGO to establish a Kerberos secure context. \
For example: The host name is testMachine.austin.ibm.com. The Kerberos SPN is a string of the form HTTP/testMachine.austin.ibm.com@kerberosRealm. The complete SPN is used with the Java Generic Security Service (JGSS) by the SPNEGO provider to obtain the client Kerberos credential used in the authentication process.

canonicalHostName=Use canonical host name
canonicalHostName.desc= Controls whether you want to use the canonical host name.

krb5Config=The Kerberos configuration file with full path
krb5Config.desc=Specifies the fully qualified Kerberos configuration path and name. Standard variable substitutions, such as ${server.config.dir}, can be used when specifying the directory path.

krb5Keytab=The Kerberos keytab file name and include path
krb5Keytab.desc=Specifies the fully qualified Kerberos keytab  path and name. Standard variable substitutions, such as ${server.config.dir}, can be used when specifying the directory path. The Kerberos keytab file contains a list of keys that are analogous to user passwords. It is important for hosts to protect their Kerberos keytab files by storing them on the local disk.

kerberosRealmName= The Kerberos realm name
kerberosRealmName.desc= Specifies the name of your Kerberos realm. In most cases, your realm is your domain name in uppercase letters. For example, a machine with the domain name of test.austin.ibm.com might have a Kerberos realm name of AUSTIN.IBM.COM. If you use the MS KDC, the realm name is in uppercase letters of the MS domain controller name.

servicePrincipalNames= The Kerberos service principal names (SPN)
servicePrincipalNames.desc= Specifies a list of Kerberos service principal names separated by a comma. 

disableFailOverToAppAuthType=Disable fall back to application authentication
disableFailOverToAppAuthType.desc=Specifies that SPNEGO is used to log in to WebSphere Application Server first. However, if the login fails, then the application authentication mechanism is used to log in to the WebSphere Application Server.

spnegoNotSupportedErrorPageURL=SPNEGO not supported error page URL
spnegoNotSupportedErrorPageURL.desc=Specifies the URL of a resource that contains the content which SPNEGO includes in the HTTP response that is displayed by the browser client application if it does not support SPNEGO authentication.

ntlmTokenReceivedErrorPageURL=NTLM token received error page URL
ntlmTokenReceivedErrorPageURL.desc=Specifies the URL of a resource that contains the content which SPNEGO includes in the HTTP response, which is displayed by the browser client application.

trimKerberosRealmNameFromPrincipal=Remove the realm name from a Kerberos principal
trimKerberosRealmNameFromPrincipal.desc=Specifies whether SPNEGO removes the suffix of the Kerberos principal user name, starting from the @ that precedes the Kerberos realm name. If this attribute is set to true, the suffix of the principal user name is removed. If this attribute is set to false, the suffix of the principal name is retained.

includeClientGSSCredentialInSubject=Add the client delegation credentials to subject
includeClientGSSCredentialInSubject.desc=Specifies whether the client delegation credentials should be stored in a client subject.

authFilterRef=Authentication Filter Reference
authFilterRef$Ref=Authentication filter reference
authFilterRef.desc=Specifies the authentication filter reference. 

disableLtpaCookie=Disable LTPA cookie
disableLtpaCookie.desc=Do not create an LTPA cookie during processing of the SPNEGO token. No LTPA cookie is added to the HTTP response.
