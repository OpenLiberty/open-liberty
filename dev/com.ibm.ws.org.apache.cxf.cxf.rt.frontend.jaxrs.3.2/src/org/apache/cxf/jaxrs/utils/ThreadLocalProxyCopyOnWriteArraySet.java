/**
 * A {@link java.util.Set} that uses an internal {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList} for all of its operations. Thus, it shares the same basic properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It is best suited for applications in which set sizes generally
 * stay small, read-only operations
 * vastly outnumber mutative operations, and you need
 * to prevent interference among threads during traversal.
 * <li>It is thread-safe.
 * <li>Mutative operations (<tt>add</tt>, <tt>set</tt>, <tt>remove</tt>, etc.)
 * are expensive since they usually entail copying the entire underlying
 * array.
 * <li>Iterators do not support the mutative <tt>remove</tt> operation.
 * <li>Traversal via iterators is fast and cannot encounter
 * interference from other threads. Iterators rely on
 * unchanging snapshots of the array at the time the iterators were
 * constructed.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p> <b>Sample Usage.</b> The following code sketch uses a
 * copy-on-write set to maintain a set of Handler objects that
 * perform some action upon state updates.
 * 
 * <pre> {@code class Handler void handle(); ... }
 * 
 * class X {
 * private final CopyOnWriteArraySet<Handler> handlers
 * = new CopyOnWriteArraySet<Handler>();
 * public void addHandler(Handler h) { handlers.add(h); }
 * 
 * private long internalState;
 * private synchronized void changeState() { internalState = ...; }
 * 
 * public void update() {
 * changeState();
 * for (Handler handler : handlers)
 * handler.handle();
 * }
 * }}</pre>
