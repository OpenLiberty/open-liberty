# Uncomment to use remote docker host to simulate continuous build behavior.
# This will only work if you are on the IBM Network.
# External contributors will need to have docker installed on their local machine.
#fat.test.use.remote.docker: true

# Uncomment to test against alternative databases
# This allows you to locally tell gradle what database you want to test against.
# This is the same way the database rotation build sets the database. 
# Options: Derby, Postgre, DB2, Oracle, SQLServer
#fat.bucket.db.type: Postgre

# NOTE: If you uncomment or change any of these properties locally
# you may need to run ./gradlew --stop to get a new gradle daemon
# it has been my experience that these properties are likely to be cached. 

# Define additional tested features that are NOT present in any XML files in this bucket.
# In this case, servlet-5.0 is added programmatically at runtime by the RepeatTests rule.
# The databaseRotation feature is required to tell the SOE build system that this FAT suite
# should be run in the databaseRotation build.
