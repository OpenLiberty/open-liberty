# This property is used to tell the SOE build system that this FAT suite
# should be run in the database rotation build.
fat.test.databases: true

# Uncomment to test against alternative databases
# This allows you to locally tell gradle what database you want to test against.
# This is the same way the database rotation build sets the database. 
# Options: Derby, Postgre, DB2, Oracle, SQLServer
#fat.bucket.db.type: Postgre

# NOTE: If you uncomment or change any of these properties locally
# you may need to run ./gradlew --stop to get a new gradle daemon
# it has been my experience that these properties are likely to be cached.
