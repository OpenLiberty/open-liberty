# Uncomment to use remote docker host to simulate continuous build behavior.
# This will only work if you are on the IBM Network.
# External contributors will need to have docker installed on their local machine.
#fat.test.use.remote.docker: true

# This property is used to tell the SOE build system that this FAT suite
# should be run in the database rotation build.
fat.test.databases: true

# Uncomment to test against alternative databases
# This allows you to locally tell gradle what database you want to test against.
# This is the same way the database rotation build sets the database. 
# Options: Derby, Postgre, DB2, Oracle, SQLServer
#fat.bucket.db.type: Postgre

# NOTE: If you uncomment or change any of these properties locally
# you may need to run ./gradlew --stop to get a new gradle daemon
# it has been my experience that these properties are likely to be cached. 

# io.openliberty.org.testcontainers bundle should have all compile time
# dependences you need for a testcontainer enabled fat project.
# If you are creating a fat test that needs a module not currenlty in the
# bundle please add it!
