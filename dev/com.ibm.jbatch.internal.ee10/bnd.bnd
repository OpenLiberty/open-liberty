# Though we've forked the open source RI in this project, we still are

# the internals in com.ibm.jbatch.container from other parts of the WAS project
# should be kept in some part of our minds as we work in open source.

# Using version=! in order to not have a version attached to the import for packages that were removed
# from Java after Java 8.  Doing this keeps the import like before Java 11 support. It will get the 
# packages from Java when using Java 8 or earlier and from the new shipped bundles for Java 9 and later.
