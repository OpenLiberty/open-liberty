# Do not translate sslRef, orb, defaultKeyStore, defaultSSLConfig, ssl in "ssl element".
SSL_SERVICE_NOT_STARTED=CWWKS9582E: The {0} sslRef attributes required by the orb element with the {1} id have not been resolved within {2} seconds. As a result, the applications will not start. Ensure that you have included a keyStore element and that Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is configured correctly. If the sslRef is defaultSSLConfig, then add a keyStore element with the id defaultKeyStore and a password.
SSL_SERVICE_NOT_STARTED.explanation= The applications have not started because at least one ssl element referenced by an sslRef attribute of the given orb element has not been resolved after a certain period of time. This failure can be due to an SSL configuration that is not valid, such as a missing keyStore element or the SSL certificate not being created within the allotted time. After the configuration error is corrected, the applications will start.
SSL_SERVICE_NOT_STARTED.useraction= Ensure that you have configured a keyStore element, and that each sslRef attribute points to a valid ssl element that is configured properly. If the sslRef is defaultSSLConfig, then add a keyStore element with the id defaultKeyStore and a password. If the SSL certificate was not created, use the createSSLCertificate task of the securityUtility command to create the SSL certificate manually.
