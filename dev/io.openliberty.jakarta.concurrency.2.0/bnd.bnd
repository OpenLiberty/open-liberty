#Because the implementation is shared between both 1.0 and 2.0, this API bundle is being shipped as GA already (with the 1.0 feature).
#However, we don't want to expose it to users just yet because the 2.0 Jakarta API and our 2.0 implementation feature are not ready.
#When the 2.0 feature moves to beta then this bundle should be moved from lib to dev/api/spec by uncommenting the line below.
