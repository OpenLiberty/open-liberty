# --------------------------------
ATTEMPT_TO_SHARE_LTC_CONNECTION_J2CA0086=J2CA0086I: Multiple open connection handles cannot share a physical connection to {1} within a local transaction containment boundary, so a different physical connection will be used for each connection handle. In this situation, it is important to ensure that no transactional work remains in progress after connection handle close because if additional sharable connection handles are later requested within the local transaction containment boundary, the physical connection to which they associate will be unpredictable.
ATTEMPT_TO_SHARE_LTC_CONNECTION_J2CA0086.explanation=Multiple open connection handles can only share a single physical connection within the scope of a global transaction. When multiple connection handles are open within a local transaction containment boundary, each handle uses a different physical connection. Having multiple shareable connection handles open at the same time within a local transaction containment boundary can increase the requirement on the connection pool for maximum number of connections and can greatly increase the complexity of connection handle usage with respect to local transactions for applications that follow this pattern.
ATTEMPT_TO_SHARE_LTC_CONNECTION_J2CA0086.useraction=Ensure the connection pool is sized so that each thread can require multiple physical connections, and review the application code to verify that this usage pattern is desired and that the expected sharing scope is specified.
