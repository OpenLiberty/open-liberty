# Connection Manager

connectionManager=Connection Manager
connectionManager.desc=Connection Manager configuration

agedTimeout=Aged timeout
agedTimeout.desc=Amount of time before a connection can be discarded by pool maintenance. A value of -1 disables this timeout. A value of 0 discards every connection, which disables connection pooling.

connTimeout=Connection timeout
connTimeout.desc=Amount of time after which a connection request times out. A value of -1 disables this timeout, meaning infinite wait. A value of 0 is immediate, meaning no wait.

maxIdleTime=Maximum idle time
maxIdleTime.desc=Amount of time a connection can be unused or idle until it can be discarded during pool maintenance, if doing so does not reduce the pool below the minimum size. A value of -1 disables this timeout.

maxPoolSize=Maximum connections
maxPoolSize.desc=Maximum number of physical connections for a pool. A value of 0 means unlimited.

minPoolSize=Minimum connections
minPoolSize.desc=Minimum number of physical connections to maintain in the pool. The pool is not pre-populated. Aged timeout can override the minimum.

purgePolicy=Purge policy
purgePolicy.desc=Specifies which connections to destroy when a stale connection is detected in a pool.
purgePolicy.EntirePool.desc=When a stale connection is detected, all connections in the pool are marked stale, and when no longer in use, are closed.
purgePolicy.FailingConnectionOnly.desc=When a stale connection is detected, only the connection which was found to be bad is closed.
purgePolicy.ValidateAllConnections.desc=When a stale connection is detected, connections are tested and those found to be bad are closed.

reapTime=Reap time
reapTime.desc=Amount of time between runs of the pool maintenance thread. A value of -1 disables pool maintenance.

# Connection Manager advanced properties

maxConPerThd=Maximum open connections per thread
maxConPerThd.desc=Limits the number of open connections on each thread.

numConPerThd=Number of cached connections per thread
numConPerThd.desc=Caches the specified number of connections for each thread.

enableSharing=Enable connection sharing for direct lookups
enableSharing.desc=If set to true, connections are shared. If set to false, connections are unshared.
