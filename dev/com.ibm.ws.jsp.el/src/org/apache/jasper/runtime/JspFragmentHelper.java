/**
 * Helper class from which all Jsp Fragment helper classes extend.
 * This class allows for the emulation of numerous fragments within
 * a single class, which in turn reduces the load on the class loader
 * since there are potentially many JspFragments in a single page.
 * <p>
 * The class also provides various utility methods for JspFragment
 * implementations.
