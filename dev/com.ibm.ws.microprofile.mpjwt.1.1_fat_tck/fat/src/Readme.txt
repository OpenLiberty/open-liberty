This TCK runs the tests from here:

https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth

All of the new microprofile tck fats use a similar approach, which differs from a regular FAT. 

Each mpjwt11TckLauncher*  wraps some maven-based tests into a single Liberty FAT.

The build\libs\autoFVT\results\junit.html\index.html results file is just a summary.  

The details are in 4 more files, build\libs\autoFVT\results\tck_(server name)\surefire-reports\index.html

Each of those contains the detailed test results for a test suite.

The tck requires multiple server configurations to run, it won't all run under a single server config.
For this reason the tck suite has been broken into 4 separate suites, each with it's own server.

Servers and test suites are configured as follows:

	tck_aud_env - allowed audiences are defined, and mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location and mp.jwt.verify.issuer are set in server.env.
	              These test applications contain a pem file, but do not contain a microprofile-config-properties file.
	              
	tck_aud_noenv -  audiences are defined, but mpjwt properties are not, 
	                 so tests that contain microprofile-config.properties file can exercise their properties.
	                 
	tck_aud_noenv2 - same but requires a different maven prop passed in
	
	tck_noaud_env - these tests omit an audience so the server is configured for that.
	
    There's a corresponding maven file tck_suite_(name).xml to run the suite on each server. 
	

Debugging:

   First the Liberty harness tries to run the launchers, so check there and output.txt first for errors.
   
   Next each launcher spawns a maven run of a suite, the output from maven is in 
   build\libs\autoFVT\results\mvnOutput_(suite_name).    It's usually not useful
   unless something's gone terribly wrong.
   
   When reviewing messages.log, note that each app usually (but not always)
   corresponds to the test class name.  It's installed right before the testcases
   run and removed right after.  That helps identify where in the log to look.
   
   Most of the tests work by having a rest client in the testcase access a rest 
   service in the test application.  The rest services are usually named
   (some-test)Endpoint and the testcase itself (some-test)Test.
   
   
Todo:
  We're running a slightly modified version of the tests while changes are made
  to the main copy.  Once that's done, we need to pull from the main copy directly. 
  Update pom.xml and build.gradle to do that.
