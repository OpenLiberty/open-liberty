OPEN_API_SLASH_IN_MODULE_CWWKO1679W=CWWKO1679W: The configured {0} module name in the {1} element is not valid as it is not in the format "<application-name>/<module-name>".
OPEN_API_SLASH_IN_MODULE_CWWKO1679W.explanation=A module must be in the format "<application-name>/<module-name>"; therefore, a module name without a "/" is not valid.
OPEN_API_SLASH_IN_MODULE_CWWKO1679W.useraction=Correct the includeModule or excludeModule element in your server.xml file, or convert that element to includeApplication or excludeApplication to reference an entire application.

OPENAPI_USING_WRONG_NAME_SOURCE_CWWKO1680W=CWWKO1680W: The {1} application name in the {0} configuration element does not match the name of any deployed application, but it matches either the name from the deployment descriptor or the archive name of the {2} application.

OPENAPI_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED_CWWK06182W.explanation=The openAPIVersion attribute of the mpOpenAPI configuration element is set to an OpenAPI version that is not supported by the running version of the mpOpenAPI feature.
OPENAPI_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED_CWWK06182W.useraction=Update the openAPIVersion attribute to one of the supported values from the error message, or use a version of the mpOpenAPI feature that supports the configured OpenAPI version.

# "mpOpenAPI", "info", "title" and "version" are names in server.xml and should not be translated
OPENAPI_INFO_INVALID_SERVERXML_CWWKO1683W=CWWKO1683W: The mpOpenAPI info configuration element in the server.xml file is invalid. Both the title and version attributes must be set. The info element will be ignored.
OPENAPI_INFO_INVALID_SERVERXML_CWWKO1683W.explanation=The title and version fields are required properties in the info object of an OpenAPI document. When configuring the info object, a value must be provided for the title and version attributes.
