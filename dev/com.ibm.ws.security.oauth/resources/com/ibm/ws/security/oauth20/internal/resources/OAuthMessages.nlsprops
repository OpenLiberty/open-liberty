OAUTH_INVALID_REQUEST_NO_AUTHHEADER.useraction=Issue the request again with valid client authentication information in the Authorization header.

OAUTH_CLIENTINREQ_DONOT_MATCH_AT=CWWKS1492E: The {0} request sent to URI {1} is not valid. The client that is represented by the access token does not match the client that is provided in the request.
OAUTH_CLIENTINREQ_DONOT_MATCH_AT.explanation=The specified request must include an access token for the same client that is provided in the Authorization header.
OAUTH_CLIENTINREQ_DONOT_MATCH_AT.useraction=Issue the request again with an access token for the client that is provided in the Authorization header.
