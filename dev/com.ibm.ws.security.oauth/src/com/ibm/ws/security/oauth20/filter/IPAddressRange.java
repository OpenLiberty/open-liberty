/**
 * This class represents an IP Address range and handles "comparison" operations against them. It is used
 * by ValueAddressRange to complete the abstraction.
 *
 * An IPAddressRange is really just two IP addresses: a lower address and an upper address (which are numerically
 * related). IPV4 addresses are just a 32 bit number while IPV6 addresses are a 128bit number. To make this
 * code as simple and portable as possible, it lets the native JDK InetAddress class do the parsing of addresses
 * whenever possible. The native JDK of course understands IPV4 and V6 formats.
 *
 * However, since this class supports *ranges* not single addresses, it has to parse the IP address to some degree
 * in order to expand the wildcards/ranges. For the purposes of this class, an IP address is a series of
 * decimal or hex digits separated by colon (:) or dot (.). Each element in this list is an address element.
 * If the element contains a special range character (* or []) then this class handles the interpretation and
 * expansion. Otherwise, that native JDK does the work. More concretely, an input address range is parsed and
 * expanded into two addresses (upper and lower) and the JDK is left to interpret that. Thus:
 * 192.168.1.3 becomes 192.168.1.3 and 192.168.1.3
 * 192.168.*.* becomes 192.168.0.0 and 192.168.255.255
 * 192.17.[3-9].* becomes 192.17.3.0 and 192.17.9.255
 * 1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:417A becomes 1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:417A and 1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:417A
 * 1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:* becomes 1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:0 and 1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:FFFF
 *
 * Note: It is possible to specify IP addresses that aren't actually legal, but that's
 * irrelevant for our purposes. We are merely trying to match (presumed value) IP addresses against a range.
 *
 * Essentially, we are just processing strings, not understanding the address. Note that we require that after
 * the first wildcard or range specifier that the remainder of the address be wildcards. Thus, a range must
 * consist of exactly *one* range, not mulitple ranges. Thus, for example, this is illegal:
 * 192.[2-3].[9-12].* - this is more than one IP address
 *
 * Once the InetAddress objects are complete, we can support various comparison operations by directly looking
 * at their byte representations: either 4 bytes or 16 bytes.
 *
