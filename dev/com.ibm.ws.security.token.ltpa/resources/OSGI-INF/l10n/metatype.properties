#===== LTPA TOKEN CONFIGURATION ====
ltpa.token.config=LTPA Token
ltpa.token.config.desc=Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) token configuration.

keysFileName=The LTPA primary keys file
keysFileName.desc=The path to the file that contains the LTPA primary keys, which are used to create and validate LTPA tokens.

keysPassword=LTPA primary keys password
keysPassword.desc=Password for the LTPA primary keys. The best practice is to encrypt the password by using the securityUtility tool.

expiration=LTPA token expiration
expiration.desc=Amount of time after which a token expires in seconds. The value can be specified in milliseconds, seconds, and minutes by using the following suffixes: "ms", "s", and "m".

ltpa.monitorInterval=LTPA keys file polling rate
ltpa.monitorInterval.desc=Rate at which the server checks for updates to the LTPA keys file. This rate applies to both the primary keys and the validation keys.

ltpa.monitorValidationKeysDir=LTPA monitor validation keys directory
ltpa.monitorValidationKeysDir.desc=If set to "true", the directory that contains LTPA primary keys is monitored for any modifications on files with the .keys suffix. The default value is false. All validation files must use the same password as the LTPA primary keys password and must have the .keys suffix.

ltpa.updateTrigger=LTPA keys update trigger
ltpa.updateTrigger.desc=Specifies the update method or trigger that is used to update the LTPA keys. The following values are supported: "polled", "mbean" and "disabled". The default value is "polled".
ltpa.updateTrigger.timed=The server scans for LTPA key file changes at the monitor interval and updates if the LTPA key files have any detectable changes. 
ltpa.updateTrigger.mbean=All the LTPA keys are reloaded when triggered by an MBean call. This is typically called by an external program, such as an integrated development environment or a management application.
ltpa.updateTrigger.disabled=This disables all update monitoring on all LTPA key files including primary key and validation keys (configured and non-configured). Changes to the LTPA key files are not applied while the server is running.

authFilterRef=Authentication Filter Reference
authFilterRef$Ref=Authentication filter reference
authFilterRef.desc=Specifies the authentication filter reference. 

validationKeys=LTPA Validation Keys
validationKeys.desc=The LTPA keys that are used only for validating existing LTPA tokens, not for creating new LTPA tokens.

fileName=LTPA validation keys file
fileName.desc=The name of the file that contains the LTPA validation keys. The path must be the same as the LTPA primary keys file.

password=LTPA validation keys password
password.desc=The password for the LTPA validation keys. The best practice is to encrypt the password by using the securityUtility tool.

validUntilDate=LTPA validation keys valid until date
validUntilDate.desc=A date and time value in ISO date format that the LTPA validation key is valid until. After the specified time, the validation keys is no longer used for LTPA token validation. The following example shows the ISO date format: "2023-11-18T18:08:35Z". If no value is specified, the LTPA validation keys can be used indefinitely.
