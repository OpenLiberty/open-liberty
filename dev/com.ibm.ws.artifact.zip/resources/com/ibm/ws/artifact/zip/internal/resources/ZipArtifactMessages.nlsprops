extract.cache.fail.useraction=Check the reported cause.

# # {0} A file path.
extract.cache.null=CWWKM0104E: The system could not extract nested archive {0} to a cache location.
extract.cache.null.explanation=An error occurred during creation of cache data for the application, preventing the application from being processed correctly. 
extract.cache.null.useraction=Check that the nested archive is a valid archive.

# # {0} A file path.
extract.secondary.timeout=CWWKM0105E: Secondary extraction timeout for {0}.
extract.secondary.timeout.explanation=A concurrent request to extract a nested archive timed out waiting for the initial extraction to complete.
extract.secondary.timeout.useraction=Check that the nested archive is a valid archive.

# # {0} A file path
extract.secondary.failed=CWWKM0106E: Failed secondary extraction for {0}.
extract.secondary.failed.explanation=A concurrent request to extract a nested archive completed but did not extract the nested archive.
extract.secondary.failed.useraction=Check that the nested archive is a valid archive.

# # {0} A file path
extract.secondary.notfile=CWWKM0107E: Secondary extraction did not create a simple file for {0}.
extract.secondary.notfile.explanation=A concurrent request to extract a nested archive completed but did not produce a simple file.
extract.secondary.notfile.useraction=Check that the nested archive is a valid archive.

extract.secondary.inconsistent=CWWKM0108E: Secondary extraction inconsistent times for {0}.
extract.secondary.inconsistent.explanation=A concurrent request to extract a nested archive completed but produced a different file than was expected.
extract.secondary.inconsistent.useraction=Check that the nested archive is a valid archive.

# # {0} A file path
extract.primary.directory=CWWKM0109E: Prior extraction of {0} is a directory.
extract.primary.directory.explanation=An extraction of a nested archive has detected a directory as the prior extracted archive.
extract.primary.directory.useraction=Clean then restart the server to ensure no prior cache contents are present.

# # {0} A file path
extract.primary.untyped=CWWKM0110E: Prior extraction of {0} cannot be typed.
extract.primary.untyped.explanation=An extraction of a nested archive has detected an untypable file as the prior extracted archive.
extract.primary.untyped.useraction=Clean then restart the server to ensure no prior cache contents are present.

# # {0} A file path.
# # {1} A print name
reaper.inactive=CWWKM0121W: Cannot open {0}: Archive cache {1} is inactive.
reaper.inactive.explanation=A request to open an archive file failed because the archive file cache is not active.
reaper.inactive.useraction=This message indicates an internal programming error.

# # {0} A file path
reaper.unregistered.path=CWWKM0122W: Ignoring close request for archive {0}, which is not open.
reaper.unregistered.path.explanation=Archive file close processing was requested for an archive file which was not opened.
reaper.unregistered.path.useraction=This messages indicates an internal programming error.

# # {0} A file path
reaper.closed.path=CWWKM0123W: Ignoring close request for archive {0}, which is already closed.

# # {0} A file path
# # {1} An integer representing a file length
# # {2} An integer representing a file length
reaper.unexpected.length.change=CWWKM0125W: Archive {0}: Update length from {1} to {2}.
reaper.unexpected.length.change.explanation=An unexpected update was made to an application archive file while that archive was open.  This usually occurs because a dynamic update was made to application files.
reaper.unexpected.length.change.useraction=Restart the server.  When updating application files, wait for the server to quiesce, plus wait at least a half second to allow application files to be closed.

# # {0} A file path
