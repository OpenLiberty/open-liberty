extract.cache.null.explanation=An error occurred during creation of cache data for the application, preventing the application from being processed correctly. 
extract.cache.null.useraction=Check that the nested archive is a valid archive.

# # {0} A file path.
extract.secondary.timeout=CWWKM0105E: Secondary extraction timeout for {0}.
extract.secondary.timeout.explanation=A concurrent request to extract a nested archive timed out waiting for the initial extraction to complete.
extract.secondary.timeout.useraction=Check that the nested archive is a valid archive.

# # {0} A file path
extract.secondary.failed=CWWKM0106E: Failed secondary extraction for {0}.
extract.secondary.failed.explanation=A concurrent request to extract a nested archive completed but did not extract the nested archive.
extract.secondary.failed.useraction=Check that the nested archive is a valid archive.

# # {0} A file path
extract.secondary.notfile=CWWKM0107E: Secondary extraction did not create a simple file for {0}.
extract.secondary.notfile.explanation=A concurrent request to extract a nested archive completed but did not produce a simple file.
extract.secondary.notfile.useraction=Check that the nested archive is a valid archive.

# # {0} A file path
extract.secondary.inconsistent=CWWKM0108E: Secondary extraction inconsistent times for {0}.
extract.secondary.inconsistent.explanation=A concurrent request to extract a nested archive completed but produced a different file than was expected.
extract.secondary.inconsistent.useraction=Check that the nested archive is a valid archive.

# # {0} A file path
extract.primary.directory=CWWKM0109E: Prior extraction of {0} is a directory.
extract.primary.directory.explanation=An extraction of a nested archive has detected a directory as the prior extracted archive.
extract.primary.directory.useraction=Clean then restart the server to ensure no prior cache contents are present.

# # {0} A file path
extract.primary.untyped=CWWKM0110E: Prior extraction of {0} cannot be typed.
extract.primary.untyped.explanation=An extraction of a nested archive has detected an untypable file as the prior extracted archive.
extract.primary.untyped.useraction=Clean then restart the server to ensure no prior cache contents are present.

# # {0} A decimal count of seconds.  For example, "0.701005".
# # {1} A decomal count of seconds.  For example, "0.020000".
reaper.stall=CWWKM0120W: An excessive delay occurred while processing pending archive closes: The actual delay was {0} seconds.  The requested delay was {1} seconds.
reaper.stall.explanation=This message indicates that application archive files were kept open longer than necessary.  As shown by the warning message, archive files should have been kept open no longer than a requested duration, but were kept open for a significantly longer actual duration.  That archive files were kept open longer than necessary can cause errors when attempting to dynamically update application files.  This warning indicates that activity, external or internal, is denying processing time to the server.
reaper.stall.useraction=Examine the environment to determine if processes other than the server process are consuming an excess proportion of processing time.  Examine the server process by generating thread dumps to determine if particular server threads have excessive activity.

# # {0} A file path.
# # {1} A print name
reaper.inactive=CWWKM0121W: Cannot open {0}: Archive cache {1} is inactive.
reaper.inactive.explanation=A request to open an archive file failed because the archive file cache is not active.
reaper.inactive.useraction=This message indicates an internal programming error.

# # {0} A file path
reaper.unregistered.path=CWWKM0122W: Ignoring close request for archive {0}, which is not open.
reaper.unregistered.path.explanation=Archive file close processing was requested for an archive file which was not opened.
reaper.unregistered.path.useraction=This messages indicates an internal programming error.

# # {0} A file path
reaper.closed.path=CWWKM0123W: Ignoring close request for archive {0}, which is already closed.
reaper.closed.path.explanation=Archive file close processing was requested for an archive file which was already closed.
reaper.closed.path.useraction=This messages indicates an internal programming error.

# # {0} A file path
reaper.pending.path=CWWKM0243W: Ignoring close request for archive {0}, which is already pending closure {0}.
reaper.pending.path.explanation=Archive file close processing was requested for an archive file which is already pending closure.
reaper.pending.path.useraction=This messages indicates an internal programming error.

# # {0} A file path
# # {1} An integer representing a file length
# # {2} An integer representing a file length
reaper.unexpected.length.change=CWWKM0125W: Archive {0}: Update length from {1} to {2}.
reaper.unexpected.length.change.explanation=An unexpected update was made to an application archive file while that archive was open.  This usually occurs because a dynamic update was made to application files.
reaper.unexpected.length.change.useraction=Restart the server.  When updating application files, wait for the server to quiesce, plus wait at least a half second to allow application files to be closed.

# # {0} A file path
# # {1} An integer representing a last modified time
# # {2} An integer representing a last modified time
reaper.unexpected.lastmodified.change=CWWKM0126W: Archive {0}: Update last modified from {1} to {2}.
reaper.unexpected.lastmodified.change.explanation=An unexpected update was made to an application archive file while that archive was open.  This usually occurs because a dynamic update was made to application files.
reaper.unexpected.lastmodified.change.useraction=Restart the server.  When updating application files, wait for the server to quiesce, plus wait at least a half second to allow application files to be closed.

# # {0} A file path
reaper.reopen.active=CWWKM0127W: Reopen {0}
reaper.reopen.active.explanation=An unexpected change has caused an open application archive file to be re-opened.  The server has attempted to obtain the updated contents of the archive file, but may not have fully updated internal listings of the archive contents.
reaper.reopen.active.useraction=Restart the server.  When updating application files, wait for the server to quiesce, plus wait at least a half second to allow application files to be closed.
