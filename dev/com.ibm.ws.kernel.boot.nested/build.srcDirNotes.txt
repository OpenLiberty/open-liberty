These classes have access to: 
 * org.osgi core APIs
 * aries util classes
 * Tr/FFDC
 
**
NOTE:  
These classes do not have access to anything loaded by the parent classloader
that is not com.ibm.ws.kernel.boot.* 

If they reference such a class, it will be reloaded inside the nested classloader
(you will have two copies).
**
 
Classes from this source directory should not directly call System.out or System.err,
because Tr and FFDC are available, and should be used.

Exported packages are seen by the framework as though provided by the OSGi Framework's system bundle.
