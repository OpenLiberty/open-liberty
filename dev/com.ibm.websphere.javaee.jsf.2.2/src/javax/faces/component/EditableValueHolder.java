/**
 * Defines the methods required for a component whose value can be modified by the user.
 * <p>
 * When a component implementing this interface is rendered, the value output is (in order):
 * <ul>
 * <li>The "submitted value" if non-null.
 * <li>The component's "local value" if non-null.
 * <li>The result of evaluating the value-binding expression with name "value" for this component.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Rendering the submitted value if non-null allows a component to redisplay a user-provided value when validation fails
 * for the component. The submitted value is usually just the plain string extracted from the servlet request. During
 * successful validation of the component, the submitted value is converted to an appropriate datatype, and stored as
 * the component's "local value", and then the "submitted value" is immediately reset to null.
 * <p>
 * Rendering the "local value" if non-null allows a component to redisplay a page when validation fails for some other
 * component; the model can't be updated unless <i>all</i> components have passed validation. This also allows
 * components to work without a defined "value" value-binding expression. When all components validate, the update model
 * phase runs; all components with "value" value-bindings store the "local value" into the specified property then reset
 * their local value to null.
 * <p>
 * Rendering the value-binding expression named "value" allows components to display data from the user's model classes.
 * This is the most common way a component's renderer obtains the value to display.
 * 
 * see Javadoc of <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/1.2/docs/api/index.html">JSF Specification</a> for
 * more.
