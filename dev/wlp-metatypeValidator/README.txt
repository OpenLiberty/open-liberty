Liberty Metatype Validator Documentation

This tool validates the liberty metatype files, looking for misspellings, unrecognized attributes,
invalid attributes (such as type="Integer" and ibm:type="duration(s)", default values out of the
specified min/max range), ensuring properties have the proper translation, and so forth.

This tool must be built BEFORE all of the components are built - hence the build-prep.xml build file.

This tool will run every time a component is build, however if you are doing a full build (buildLite, 
rebuildLite, build) metatype validation will be deferred until the end of the build process. This will
save time.

Upon completion, a report will be generated. Typically this resides in /build/reports/metatypeValidator
for individual components or build.image/output/metatypeValidator for full builds.

There are three types of messages:
info: just some information about a property; everything looks good
warning: you need to look at this; while I don't think it is a breaking thing, you need to review it.
error: this needs to be fixed; something is wrong here that will likely be breaking or goes against
       best practices.

Errors generated by this tool can be suppressed just like Findbugs. However, instead of using 
findbugs.exclude.xml you use validator.exclude.xml.

See validator.exclude.example.xml for an example.

To run this in your local sandbox after building your project, 
cd ../ant_build
ant -f build-liberty.xml executeMetatypeValidation 2>&1|tee temp.log
check the output for "FAILURE"
