7121={0} does not support stored functions

7122=The exclusive connection associated with the session is unavailable for the query on {0}

7123=A successful writeChanges() has been called on this UnitOfWork.  As the commit process has been started but not yet finalized, the only supported operations now are commit, commitAndResume, release, any non-object level query or SQLCall execution.  The operation {0} is not allowed at this time.

7124=An unsuccessful writeChanges() has been called on this UnitOfWork.  Given the danger that partial changes have been written to the datastore but not rolled back (if inside external transaction), the only supported operations now are release, global transaction rollback, any non-object level query or SQLCall execution.  The operation {0} was attempted.

7125=Once the UnitOfWork has been committed and/or released, no further operation should be performed on it.  The operation {0} was attempted on it.

7126=writeChanges cannot be called on a nested UnitOfWork.  A nested UnitOfWork never writes changes directly to the datastore, only the parent UnitOfWork does.

7127=You can only writes changes to the datastore once, just as you can only call commit once.

7128=Session [{0}] is already logged in.

7129=The method''s arguments cannot have null value.

7130=Nested UnitOfWork is not supported for attribute change tracking.

7131={0} is the wrong type.  The collection change event type has to be add or remove.

7140=Sequence type {0} does not have method {1}.

7141={0} sequence is of type DefaultSequence, which cannot be used in setDefaultSequence method.

7142={0} sequence cannot be set as default, because a sequence with that name has been already added

7143={0} sequence cannot be added, because a sequence with that name has been already set as default.

7144={0}: platform {1} does not support {2}.

7145={2} attempts to connect to sequence {0}, but it is already connected to {1}. Likely the two sessions share the DatasourcePlatform object

7146=QuerySequence {1} does not have select query.

7147=Platform {0} cannot create platform default sequence - it does not override createPlatformDefaultSequence method

7148=commitAndResume() cannot be used with a JTA/synchronized UnitOfWork.

7149=The composite primary key attribute [{2}] of type [{4}] on entity class [{0}] should be of the same type as defined on its primary key class [{1}]. That is, it should be of type [{3}].

7150=Invalid composite primary key specification. The names of the primary key fields or properties in the primary key class [{1}] and those of the entity bean class [{0}] must correspond and their types must be the same. Also, ensure that you have specified ID elements for the corresponding attributes in XML and/or an @Id on the corresponding fields or properties of the entity class.

7151=The type [{1}] for the attribute [{0}] on the entity class [{2}] is not a valid type for an enumerated mapping. The attribute must be defined as a Java enum.

7153=Mapping annotations cannot be applied to fields or properties that have a @Transient specified. [{0}] is in violation of this restriction.

7154=The attribute [{3}] in entity class [{2}] has a mappedBy value of [{1}] which does not exist in its owning entity class [{0}]. If the owning entity class is a @MappedSuperclass, this is invalid, and your attribute should reference the correct subclass.

7155=The type [{1}] for the attribute [{0}] on the entity class [{2}] is not a valid type for a serialized mapping. The attribute type must implement the Serializable interface.

7156=Unable to find the class named [{0}]. Ensure the class name/path is correct and available to the classloader.

7157=Entity class [{0}] must use a @JoinColumn instead of @Column to map its relationship attribute [{1}].

7158=Error encountered when building the @NamedQuery [{1}] from entity class [{0}].

7159=The map key [{0}] on the entity class [{1}] could not be found for the mapping [{2}].

7160=@OneToMany for attribute name [{1}] in entity class [{0}] should not have JoinColumn(s) specified. Where a @OneToMany is not mapped by another entity (i.e. it is the owning side and is uni-directional) a @JoinTable must be specified, not @JoinColumn(s). If @JoinTable is not specified, a default join table will be used instead; Specify @JoinTable only if the default configuration should be overridden.

7161=Entity class [{0}] has no primary key specified. It should define either an @Id, @EmbeddedId or an @IdClass. If you have defined PK using any of these annotations then make sure that you do not have mixed access-type (both fields and properties annotated) in your entity class hierarchy.

7162=Entity class [{0}] has multiple @EmbeddedId annotations specified (on attributes [{1}] and [{2}]). Only one @EmbeddedId can be specified per Entity.

7163=Entity class [{0}] has both an @EmbdeddedId (on attribute [{1}]) and an @Id (on attribute [{2}]. Both ID types cannot be specified on the same entity.

7164=The type [{1}] for the attribute [{0}] on the entity class [{2}] is not a valid type for a lob mapping. For a lob of type BLOB, the attribute must be defined as a java.sql.Blob, byte[], Byte[] or a Serializable type. For a lob of type CLOB, the attribute must be defined as a java.sql.Clob, char[], Character[] or String type.

7165=The type [{1}] for the attribute [{0}] on the entity class [{2}] is not a valid type for a temporal mapping. The attribute must be defined as java.util.Date or java.util.Calendar.

7166=A table generator that uses the reserved name [{0}] for its "name" has been found in [{1}]. It cannot use this name because it is reserved for defaulting a sequence generator "sequence name".

7167=A sequence generator that uses the reserved name [{0}] for its "sequence name" has been found in [{1}]. It cannot use this name because it is reserved for defaulting a table generator''s "name".

7168=The attribute [{0}] of type [{1}] on the entity class [{2}] is not valid for a version property. The following types are supported: int, Integer, short, Short, long, Long, Timestamp.

7169=Class [{0}] has two @GeneratedValues: for fields [{1}] and [{2}]. Only one is allowed.

7172=Error encountered when instantiating the class [{0}].

7178=OracleOCIProxyConnector requires OracleOCIConnectionPool datasource.

7179=OracleJDBC_10_1_0_2ProxyConnectionCustomizer requires datasource producing OracleConnections.

7180=OracleJDBC_10_1_0_2ProxyConnectionCustomizer requires Oracle JDBC version 10.1.0.2 or higher so that OracleConnection declares openProxySession method.

7181=OracleJDBC_10_1_0_2ProxyConnectionCustomizer requires PersistenceUnitProperties.ORACLE_PROXY_TYPE property value to be either Integer or convertable to Integer: for instance OracleConnection.PROXYTYPE_USER_NAME or Integer.toString(OracleConnection.PROXYTYPE_USER_NAME)

7182=EC - Could not find driver class [{0}]

7183=Error closing persistence.xml file.

7184=[{0}] system property not specified. It must be set to a class that defines a "getContainerConfig()" method.

7185=Cannot find class [{0}] specified in [{1}]

7186=Cannot invoke method [{0}] on class [{1}] specified in [{2}]

7187=[{0}] should define a public static method [{1}] that has no parameters and returns Collection

7198=Class: [{0}] was not found while converting from class names to classes.

7199=A primary table was not defined for entity {0} in the entity-mappings file: {1}.  A primary table is required to process an entity relationship.

7200=The attribute [{1}] was not found on the embeddable class [{0}]. It is referenced in an attribute-override for the embedded attribute [{3}] on class [{2}].

7201=An exception occurred parsing the entity-mappings file: {0}.

7202=Attribute-override name {0} is invalid - make sure that an attribute with the same name exists in the embeddable {1}.

7203=The mapping element [{1}] for the class [{2}] has an unsupported collection type [{0}]. Only Set, List, Map and Collection are supported.

7207=Attribute [{1}] in entity class [{0}] has an invalid type for a lob of type BLOB. The attribute must be defined as a java.sql.Blob, byte[], Byte[] or a Serializable type.

7208=Attribute [{1}] in entity class [{0}] has an invalid type for a lob of type CLOB. The attribute must be defined as a java.sql.Clob, char[], Character[] or String type.

7212=The attribute [{0}] from the entity class [{1}] does not specify a temporal type. A temporal type must be specified for persistent fields or properties of type java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar.

7213=Circular mappedBy references have been specified (Class: [{0}], attribute: [{1}] and Class: [{2}], attribute: [{3}]. This is not valid, only one side can be the owner of the relationship. Therefore, specify a mappedBy value only on the non-owning side of the relationship.

7214=The target entity of the relationship attribute [{0}] on the class [{1}] cannot be determined.  When not using generics, ensure the target entity is defined on the relationship mapping.

7215=Could not load the field named [{0}] on the class [{1}]. Ensure there is a corresponding field with that name defined on the class.

7216=Could not load the method for the property name [{0}] on the class [{1}]. Ensure there is corresponding get method for that property name defined on the class.

7217=The order by value [{0}], specified on the element [{2}] from entity [{3}], is invalid. No property or field with that name exists on the target entity [{1}].

7218=[{0}] does not override getCreateTempTableSqlPrefix method. DatabasePlatforms that support temporary tables must override this method.

7219=[{0}] does not override valueFromRowInternalWithJoin method, but its isJoiningSupported method returns true. Foreign reference mapping that supports joining must override this method.

7220=The @JoinColumns on the annotated element [{0}] from the entity class [{1}] is incomplete. When the source entity class uses a composite primary key, a @JoinColumn must be specified for each join column using the @JoinColumns. Both the name and the referencedColumnName elements must be specified in each such @JoinColumn.

7222=An incomplete @PrimaryKeyJoinColumns was specified on the annotated element [{0}]. When specifying @PrimaryKeyJoinColumns for an entity that has a composite primary key, a @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn must be specified for each primary key join column using the @PrimaryKeyJoinColumns. Both the name and the referencedColumnName elements must be specified in each such @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn.

7223=A @PrimaryKeyJoinColumns was found on the annotated element [{0}]. When the entity uses a single primary key, only a single (or zero) @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn should be specified.

7224=The method [{1}] on the listener class [{0}] is an invalid callback method.

7225=The method [{1}] could not be found on the listener class [{0}].

7226=The method [{1}] on the listener class [{0}] has an invalid modifier. Callback methods cannot be static or final.

7227=The listener class [{0}] has multiple lifecycle callback methods for the same lifecycle event ([{1}] and [{2}]).

7228=The Callback method [{1}] on the listener class [{0}] has an incorrect signature. It should not have any parameters.

7229=The Callback method [{3}] on the entity listener class [{2}] has an incorrect signature. The method must take 1 parameter which must be assignable from the entity class. Here, the parameter class [{1}] is not assignable from the entity class [{0}].

7231=Cannot persist detached object [{0}]. {3}Class> {1} Primary Key> {2}

7232=The entity class [{0}] contains multiple @Id declarations, but does not define any <id> elements in the entity mappings instance document.  Please ensure that if there are multiple @Id declarations for a given entity class, the corresponding <entity> definition contains an <id> element for each.

7233=Mapping metadata cannot be applied to properties/methods that take arguments. The attribute [{0}] from class [{1}] is in violation of this restriction. Ensure the method has no arguments if it is mapped with annotations or in an XML mapping file.

7234=DDL generation requires that the class transformer, used with the transformation mapping of attribute [{1}] from the descriptor [{0}], specify a specific return type for its [{2}] method (and not Object). DDL generation requires this specific return type so that it may generate the correct field type.

7235=The class transformer used with the transformation mapping of attribute [{1}] from the descriptor [{0}] does not implement the [{2}] method. This method is part of the FieldTransformer interface and must be implemented. Note also, when implemented, its return type should also be an explicit type (and not Object) when using DDL generation.

7237=Entity name must be unique in a persistence unit. Entity name [{0}] is used for the entity classes [{1}] and [{2}].

7238=The table generator specified in [{2}] with name == [{0}] conflicts with the sequence generator with the same name specified in [{1}].

7240=The table generator specified in [{2}] with pk column value == [{0}] conflicts with the sequence generator specified in [{1}] with sequence name == [{0}]. They cannot use the same value.

7242=An attempt was made to traverse a relationship using indirection that had a null Session.  This often occurs when an entity with an uninstantiated LAZY relationship is serialized and that relationship is traversed after serialization.  To avoid this issue, instantiate the LAZY relationship prior to serialization.

7243=Missing meta data for class [{0}]. Ensure the class is not being excluded from your persistence unit by a <exclude-unlisted-classes>true</exclude-unlisted-classes> setting. If this is the case, you will need to include the class directly by adding a <class>[{0}]</class> entry for your persistence-unit.

7244=An incompatible mapping has been encountered between [{0}] and [{1}]. This usually occurs when the cardinality of a mapping does not correspond with the cardinality of its backpointer.

7245=The embeddable class [{0}] is used in classes with conflicting access types. Class [{1}] uses access [{2}] and class [{3}] uses access [{4}]. When sharing an embeddable object between classes, the access types of those embedding class must be the same.

7246=The Entity class [{0}] has an embedded attribute [{1}] of type [{2}] which is NOT an Embeddable class. Probable reason: missing @Embeddable or missing <embeddable> in orm.xml if metadata-complete = true

7247=A circular reference was discovered processing derived IDs on the following Entity classes: [{0}] 

7249=Entity [{0}] uses [{1}] as embedded ID class whose access-type has been determined as [{2}]. But [{1}] does not define any [{2}]. It is likely that you have not provided sufficient metadata in your ID class [{1}].

7250=[{0}] uses a non-entity [{1}] as target entity in the relationship attribute [{2}].

7251=The attribute [{1}] of class [{0}] is mapped to a primary key column in the database. Updates are not allowed.

7252=There are multiple mapping files called [{1}] in classpath for persistence unit named [ {0} ].

7253=There is no mapping file called [{1}] in classpath for persistence unit named [{0}].

7254=The converter with name [{1}] in the class [{0}] has mapped the data value [{2}] to multiple object values. A conversion value must map each data value only once.

7255=The class [{0}] specifies a @Convert on [{1}]. This is invalid. A @Convert is only supported with a @Basic, @BasicCollection, @BasicMap and @ElementCollection. For to-many mappings that use a map, you may use a @MapKeyConvert only.

7256=The converter with name [{1}] used with the element [{2}] in the class [{0}] was not found within the persistence unit. Please ensure you have provided the correct converter name.

7257=Unable to instantiate data value with type [{2}] and value [{1}] from the object type converter named [{0}]

7258=Unable to instantiate object value with type [{2}] and value [{1}] from the object type converter named [{0}]

7259=Unable to determine the data type for the attribute [{1}] from the entity class [{0}] that uses the converter named [{2}]. A type must be specified using the data type on the converter or your attribute should use a generic specification.

7260=Unable to determine the object type for the attribute [{1}] from the entity class [{0}] that uses the converter named [{2}]. A type must be specified using the object type on the converter or your attribute should use a generic specification.

7261=The type [{1}] for the attribute [{0}] on the entity class [{2}] is not a valid type for a basic collection mapping. The attribute must be of type Collection.class, List.class or Set.class.

7262=The type [{1}] for the attribute [{0}] on the entity class [{2}] is not a valid type for a basic map mapping. The attribute must be of type Map.class.

7263=Class [{0}] has an incomplete optimistic locking specification. For an optimistic locking policy of type SELECTED_COLUMNS, the selected columns must be specified and the names of those columns cannot be omitted.

# START NON-TRANSLATABLE
7312=An invalid embeddable class [{0}] is being used with the element collection attribute [{1}] on the class [{2}]. See section 2.6 of the spec: " An embeddable class (including an embeddable class within another embeddable class) contained within an element collection must not contain an element collection, nor may it contain a relationship to an entity other than a many-to-one or one-to-one relationship. The embeddable class must be on the owning side of such a relationship and the relationship must be mapped by a foreign key mapping." The mapping for the attribute [{3}] on the embeddable class is in violation of this.
# END NON-TRANSLATABLE

7313=The attribute [{1}] was not found on the embeddable class [{0}]. It is referenced in an association-override for the embedded attribute [{3}] on class [{2}].

7314=The mapping [{0}] is being used to map the key in a MappedKeyMapContainerPolicy and uses indirection.  Mappings used for Map Keys cannot use indirection.

7315=The map key class of the element collection attribute [{0}] on the class [{1}] cannot be determined.  When specifying a convert key with an element collection, ensure you are using a generic definition so that a class type can be determined for the converter.

7316=The MapsId value [{0}] from the mapping attribute [{1}] is invalid. An equivalent attribute with that name must be defined on the IdClass [{2}]

7317=List order field is not supported for [{0}].

7324=The entity class [{1}] specifies both a @ClassExtractor and discriminator metadata. When using a @ClassExtractor, a @DiscriminatorColumn and/or @DiscriminatorValue should not be specified on this class nor should any discriminator value metadata be defined on its subclasses.

7325=The sql result set mapping [{0}] used with the named query [{1}] from [{2}] is not a recognized sql result set mapping. Ensure the name is correct and that a sql result set mapping with that name exists.

7326=The attribute [{0}] from the class [{1}] mapped in [{2}] which uses VIRTUAL access does not specify an attribute-type. When using VIRTUAL access, an attribute-type must be specified. Note: For a one-to-one or a many-to-one, the attribute-type is specified using the target-entity. For a variable-one-to-one it is specified using the target-class.

7327=The embeddable class [{0}] is used in classes with conflicting access methods. Class [{1}] uses access methods [{2}] and class [{3}] uses access methods [{4}]. When sharing an embeddable object between classes, the access methods of those embedding class must be the same.

7328=When using VIRTUAL access a DynamicClassLoader must be provided when creating the EntityManagerFactory using the eclipselink property [eclipselink.classloader]. That is, createEntityManagerFactory(String persistenceUnitName, Map properties) and add a new DynamicClassLoader() to the Map properties.

7338=You cannot add sequences to a SessionBroker.

7339=Alias [{0}] is used by both [{1}] and [{2}] classes. Descriptor alias must be unique.

7340=There are multiple mapping files called [{0}] in classpath.

7345={0} file specified for XMLMetadataSource is not found

7346=The multitenant context property [{0}] has not been provided. When the persistence unit property (eclipselink.multitenant.tenants-share-emf) is set to false, all multitenant context properties must be provided up front. This can be done through the persistence unit definition directly or by passing a properties map containing all the multitenant context properties on the create EntityManagerFactory call.

7347=The class [{0}] specifies type level convert metadata without specifying an attribute name for each. An attribute name must be provided for all type level convert metadata to ensure the correct application to a super class attribute.

7348=The embedded mapping [{1}] from [{0}] does not specify an attribute name to which the convert is to be applied. You must specify an attribute name on the Embeddable.
