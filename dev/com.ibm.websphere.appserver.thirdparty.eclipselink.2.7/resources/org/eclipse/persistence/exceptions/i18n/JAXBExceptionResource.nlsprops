50000=The context path {0} contains no ObjectFactory or jaxb.index, no external metadata was found in properties Map, and sessions.xml was found or was invalid.

50001=The class {0} requires a zero argument constructor or a specified factory method.  Note that non-static inner classes do not have zero argument constructors and are not supported.

50002=Factory class specified without factory method on class {0}.

50003=The factory method named {0} is not declared on the class {1}.

50009=The property or field {0} on the class {1} is annotated to be transient so it cannot be included in the propOrder annotation.

50010=The property or field {0} on the class {1} must be an attribute because another field or property is annotated with XmlValue.

50011=The property or field {0} on the class {1} cannot be annotated with XmlValue since it is a subclass of another XML-bound class.

50012=The property or field {0} on the class {1} was specified in propOrder but is not a valid property.

50013=The property or field {0} on the class {1} is required to be included in the propOrder element of the XmlType annotation.
