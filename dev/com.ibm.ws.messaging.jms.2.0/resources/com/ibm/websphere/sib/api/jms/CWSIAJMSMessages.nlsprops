# File com.ibm.websphere.sib.api.jms.CWSIAJMSMessages.props
#
# SIB.api.jms component file for logging _external_ messages
#
# These messages will be formatted as follows to enable translation and problem determination key values
#
# # {0} description of each insert field
# MSG_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME_CWSIA0001=CWSIA0001I: This is a message.
# #EXPLANATION explanation text for the message
# #USERACTION user action text for the message
#
# Instructions to translation will precede the line to which it applies
#
# Some of the messages in this file are processed as
# "java.text.MessageFormat" patterns and so use the apostrophe "'" and
# open brace "{" as special characters.
#
# If you are using the IBMJDK21 markup table to translate this file,
# type apostrophe characters as you wish them to appear to the user.
# The translation tools will automatically handle whether one or two
# apostrophes characters are required when the translated file is
# exported. See the following page for more details:
#
#  http://w3.ibm.com/ux/site.nsf/g/publish/2089#IBMJDK21
#
# If you are using the IBMJDK11 markup table or are a developer working
# with this file in a text editor, use the following rules for
# apostrophe characters:
#  a) If there are inserts in the message, for example "{0}", then
#     type two apostrophe characters, that is "''".
#  b) If there are no inserts, then just type a single apostrophe.
# Examples:
#  a) message.xml.parserError.prefix=UDUT0036E: Erreur de l''analyseur syntaxique : {0}
#  b) error.getAuthInfoFailed=UDUT0078E: Impossible d'obtenir authinfo.

# {0} is the BytesMessage method that was called
PROMISE_BROKEN_EXCEPTION_CWSIA0510=CWSIA0510E: Calls to the BytesMessage method {0} are not permitted because the ConnectionFactory or ActivationSpecification property ''producerDoesNotModifyPayloadAfterSet'' has been enabled.
PROMISE_BROKEN_EXCEPTION_CWSIA0510.explanation=The message producer has promised not to modify message payloads after setting them. Calls to certain methods on message objects are considered to break this promise.
PROMISE_BROKEN_EXCEPTION_CWSIA0510.useraction=Either modify the application code to remove the offending call, or change the administration option that indicates that the promise is in place. Note that disabling the administration option may result in reduced performance.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROMISE_BROKEN_EXCEPTION_CWSIA0511=CWSIA0511E: Calling BytesMessage.writeBytes(byte[]) more than once is not permitted because the ConnectionFactory or ActivationSpecification property 'producerDoesNotModifyPayloadAfterSet' has been enabled.
PROMISE_BROKEN_EXCEPTION_CWSIA0511.explanation=The message producer has promised not to modify message payloads after setting them. Only one call to BytesMessage.writeBytes(byte[] value) is allowed in this situation.
PROMISE_BROKEN_EXCEPTION_CWSIA0511.useraction=There are three actions available to remedy the problem: 1) modify the application code to remove the offending call, 2) call BytesMessage.clearBody() after the first call, or 3) change the administration option that indicates that the promise is in place. Note that disabling the administration option may result in reduced performance.

# {0} method name
INVALID_METHOD_CWSIA0515=CWSIA0515E: CompletionListener methods must not call {0} on their own JMSContext, Session, or Connection.
INVALID_METHOD_CWSIA0515.explanation= CompletionListener methods (onComplete/OnException) must not call close, rollback, or commit operations on their own JMSContext, Session, or Connection. If you try to call those operations from their own JMSContext, Session, or Connection, an exception is thrown because the JMS provider does not permit those operations until any incomplete send messages are completed.
INVALID_METHOD_CWSIA0515.useraction= Do not call method {0} from its own JMSContext, Session, or Connection.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INVALID_MESSAGE_ACCESS_CWSIA0516=CWSIA0516E: Message objects cannot be accessed when asynchronous send is in progress.
INVALID_MESSAGE_ACCESS_CWSIA0516.explanation= According to the JMS 2.0 specification, you cannot access the message objects when the asynchronous send is still in progress.
