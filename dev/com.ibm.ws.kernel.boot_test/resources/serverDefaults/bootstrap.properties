#
# OSGi caching
# Equinox will cache information about a running server to speed up 
# class resolution when the server is restarted. Liberty and Equinox 
# will take steps to ensure that this data is refreshed if bundles in 
# the lib directory are updated, but if you are getting a lot of 
# messages about missing bundle constraints, and you know the bundle
# in question is well formed, starting with a clean slate may fix 
# things up. Uncomment the following ("osgi.clean=true") to force
# equinox to clear cached information before installing or starting
# any bundles.
# osgi.clean=true
