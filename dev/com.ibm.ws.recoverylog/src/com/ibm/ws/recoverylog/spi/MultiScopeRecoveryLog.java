/**
 * <p>
 * The MultiScopeRecoveryLog class implements the DistributedRecoveryLog interface and
 * provides support for controling a specific recovery log on behalf of a client
 * service.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class provides facilities for opening and closing the recovery log, as
 * well as access to the underlying RecoverableUnits from which it
 * is comprised.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class implements DistributedRecoveryLog rather than directly implementing
 * RecoveryLog. This intermediate interface provides additional support for
 * "service data". Service data is a byte array whose contents and size is not
 * defined by the RLS. It is supplied by the client serivce and associated with
 * the recovery log.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class also implements the LogCursorCallback interface. This interface
 * allows an instance of MultiScopeRecoveryLog to be notified when the client service
 * invokes remove on a LogCursor created by this class. This is required in order
 * to allow this class to write corrisponding deletion records to the recovery
 * log.

     * information that must be retained at any one time is referered to as the "active"
     * data. At the same time as new data is being added, older data is being deleted
     * so two key properties of a recovery log are its data throughput and its active
     * data size. The recovery log consists of two physical disk files of which one
     * at a time is used to hold the data written to disk. As information is deleted
     * from the in memory model of the recovery log, a record of these deletions is
     * also written to disk. For example, if we write records R1, R2 and R3 we have
     * a log file contents as follows:-
     *
     * [ R1 R2 R3 ... ]

     *
     * [ R1 R2 R3 D2 R4 D1 R5 R6 ... ]
     *
     * Since the file holding this information is a set size, eventually there will
     * be insufficient space to write additional records. When this occurs a "keypoint"
     * operation is driven to re-write all active data into the unused file. This then
     * becomes the target file into which new records are written. After a keypoint,
     * the new file will contain the following content :-
     *
     * [ R3 R4 R5 R6 ... ]
     *
     * This process operates fine until the active data (eg R3+R4+R5+R6) in the above
     * example is too large to fit within the log file. When this occurs, the file size
     * must be increased and these two parameters define when and how this resize
     * occurs.

     * of active data it holds. This information will be required each time a keypoint
     * occurs, in order to determine if there is sufficient space in the current file.
     * to perform the keypoint sucessfully.
     *
     * This call is driven from the recoverable unit to which data has been added and
     * accounts for both the data and header fields necessary to write the data
     * completly.
     *
     * This data has not yet been written to persistent storage and must therefour be
     * tracked in both total and unwritten data size fields. It is important to
     * understand why two parameters are required on this call rather than a single
     * value that could be reflected in both fields. The following example can be used
     * to illustrate the reason for this. Consider that data items of sizes D1, D2
     * and D3 have been added to an initially empty recovery log. If H represents the
     * size of all the header information that the underlying recoverable units, sections
     * and data items will need to form a persistent record of the data, then the

     *
     * unwritten total
     * D3 D3
     * D2 D2
     * D1 D1
     * H H
     *
     * Once this information has been written to disk, D1,D2 and D3 will be deducted
     * from the unwritten total (see payloadWritten) whilst the total data size remains
     * unchanged. Because there is then no further unwritten information there is no
     * requirement for header H, so it also is removed as follows:-
     *
     * unwritten total
     * D3
     * D2
     * D1
     * - H
     *
     * Consider that a new data item of size D4 is added. We need to add D4 + H to the
     * unwritten field and D4 alone to the total field. Since the caller takes care of
     * the size of H anyway, we need two parameters to contain this level of detail.
     * At this point the makeup of these two fields is as follows:-
     *
     * unwritten total
     * D4
     * D3
     * D2
     * D4 D1
     * H H
