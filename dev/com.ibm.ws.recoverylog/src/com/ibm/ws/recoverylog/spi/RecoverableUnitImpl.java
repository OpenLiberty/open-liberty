/**
 * <p>
 * Information written to a recovery log is grouped into arbitrary number of
 * discrete blocks called "recoverable units". The RecoverableUnitImpl class
 * represents a single recoverable unit within a recovery log. A recoverable
 * unit is identified by a key that must be supplied by the client service and
 * guaranteed to be unique within the recovery log. Client services use recoverable
 * units to group information according to their requirements. Typically, the
 * client service will group information related to a specific unit of work
 * in a single recoverable unit.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each recoverable unit is further subdivided into an arbitrary number of
 * discrete blocks called "recoverable unit sections". The RecoverableUnitSectionImpl
 * class represents a single recoverable unit section within a recoverable unit.
 * A recoverable unit section is identified by a key that must be supplied by
 * the client service and guaranteed to be unique within the recoverable unit.
 * Typically, the client service will group information of a given type into
 * a single recoverable unit section.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Information in the form of byte arrays is written to a recoverable unit section
 * rather than directly to recoverable unit.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class provides the implementation of the RecoverableUnit interface.

     * the amount of active data that it holds. This information must be passed to its
     * parent recovery log in order that it may track the amount of active data in
     * the entire recovery log.
     *
     * This call is driven by recoverable unit section to which data has been
     * added and accounts for the additional data and header fields necessary to form
     * a persistent record of the new data item.
     *
     * This data has not yet been written to persistent storage and must therefour be
     * tracked in both total and unwritten data size fields. It is important to
     * understand why two parameters are required on this call rather than a single
     * value that could be reflected in both fields. The following example can be used
     * to illustrate the reason for this. Consider that data items of sizes D1, D2
     * and D3 have been added to an initially empty recoverable unit. If H represents the

     * unwritten total

     * D2 D2
     * D1 D1
     * H H
     *
     * Once this information has been written to disk, D1,D2 and D3 will be deducted
     * from the unwritten total (see payloadWritten) whilst the total data size remains
     * unchanged. Because there is then no further unwritten information there is no
     * requirement for header H, so it also is removed as follows:-
     *
     * unwritten total
     * D3
     * D2
     * D1
     * - H
     *
     * Consider that a new data item of size D4 is added. We need to add D4 + H to the
     * unwritten field and D4 alone to the total field. Since the caller takes care of
     * the size of H anyway, we need two parameters to contain this level of detail.
     * At this point the makeup of these two fields is as follows:-
     *
