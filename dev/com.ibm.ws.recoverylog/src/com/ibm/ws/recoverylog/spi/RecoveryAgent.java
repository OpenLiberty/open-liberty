// Interface: RecoveryAgent
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * <p>
 * Each client service provides its own implementation of the RecoveryAgent
 * interface. A single instance of this object is passed to the RLS during initial
 * service registration.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The RLS will invoke this object asynchronously (by calling
 * <code>RecoveryAgent.initiateRecovery</code>) to direct the client service to
 * handle units of recovery identified by Failure Scope.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The client service responds to these requests by performing recovery
 * processing through interaction with the RLS. Once this is done, the client
 * service invokes the <code>RecoveryDirector.recoveryComplete</code> method to
 * inform the RLS that the recovery processing is complete.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * By calling recoveryComplete, the client service tells the RLS that it has
 * finished any processing for a given failure scope that has to be performed
 * synchronously. Once the client service has made this call, the RLS is free
 * to invoke the next RecoveryAgent. In practice this can only occur when the
 * recoveryAgent returns from the initiateRecovery() method. The RecoveryAgent
 * is free to perform additional recovery work after this point asynchronously.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The two likely models are:-
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>1. <code>RecoveryAgent.initiateRecovery</code> directs recovery of the
 * failure scope, and calls <code>RecoveryDirector.recoveryComplete</code>
 * when its finished. After this is done, the
 * <code>RecoveryAgent.initiateRecovery()</code> method returns. The RLS
 * then invokes the next registered RecoveryAgent.
 * <li>2. <code>RecoveryAgent.initiateRecovery</code> starts a new thread from
 * which to drive the recovery process and returns immediately. The RLS
 * blocks until the client service informs it that the failure scope has
 * been recovered, through a call to
 * <code>RecoveryDirector.recoveryComplete</code>. This will driven from
 * the new thread once any synchronous recovery processing has been
 * completed.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
