 * database. Rather than using a long duration locking scheme, the approach is to allow a first server to maintain its currency by updating
 * a timestamp in its DB table through the heartbeat() method. A second server can test whether the first server is still actively working
 * its recovery logs by calling isLogStale() against the appropriate table.
