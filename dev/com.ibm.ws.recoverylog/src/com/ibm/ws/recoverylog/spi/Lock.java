/**
* <p>
* The Lock class provides a mechanism to control access to the data structures that make up the
* in memory log. Callers can obtain two different types of 'lock' on an instance of the Lock class.
* Multiple threads may obtain concurrent 'shared' locks but only one thread at a time may obtain
* the 'exclusive' lock. 
* </p>
*
* <p>
* Normal Running Mode (Current log file is 'filling up'):-
* </p>
*
* <p>
* Shared locks are requested and released by multiple threads without blocking each other (ie
* multiple shared locks may be held by different threads at the same time) No thread is requesting
* or holding the exclusive lock.
* </p>
*
* <p>
* Exclusive Lock Requested (Threads start to discover a keypoint is required requests exclusive lock)
* </p>
*
* <p>
* Typically, a number of threads will detect that the log has run out of space and must keypoint 
* at rougly the same time. Each thread will direct a keypoint operation to occur but the code
* needs to be smart enough to perform only a single keypoint in response. 
* </p>
*
* <p>
* The required behaviour is that one of these threads perform the actuall keypoint whilst the other
* threads wait until this keypoint is complete and then return as if they had driven the keypoint.
* The code that invoked the keypoint does not know if it occured on the same thread but is guarenteed
* that all active data in memory prior to the keypoint call is stored on disk.
* </p>
*
* <p>
* An unusual locking model is required to support this. The keypoint operation will attempt to obtain
* the exclusive lock before performing the keypoint logic. It may or may not be granted (see below)
* If it is granted then the real keypoint logic is performed, otherwise the operation is actually a
* no-op. The 'attemptExclusiveLock' method returns a boolean to indicate if the lock has been
* granted or not.
* </p>
*  
* <p>
* A group of threads make the request to obtain the exclusive lock for a given keypoint event.
* These requests occur around about the same time but ultlimatly only one of these requests
* will actually be granted. The others will not be granted but the calls will remain blocked until
* the thread that does get the lock releases it again after performing a keypoint operation.
* At this point all threads will be released, those that did not get the lock simply continue
* without performing a keypoint and the cycle is ready to repeat at the next keypoint event.
* </p>
* 
* <p>
* The exclusive lock can't be granted if other threads in the system hold shared locks and this
* imposes a couple of extra rules :
*
* <ul>
* <li>1. Before a thread that requests the exclusive lock when another thread is requesting the
*     exclusive lock already can block it must "suspend" its shared locks (these are
*     restored again when it is released)</li>
* <li>2. Once a thread is requsting the exclusive lock, other threads can't be granted new shared locks
*     unless they already hold a shared lock. This will allow existing work on such threads to
*     complete (ie get to a point where the thread holds no shared locks) but not prevent this from
*     occuring by stopping further shared lock requests.</li>
* </ul>
* </p>
