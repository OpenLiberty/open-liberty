# attributes

enableTaskExecution=Enable task execution
enableTaskExecution.desc=Determines whether or not this instance may run tasks.

initialPollDelay=Initial poll delay
initialPollDelay.desc=Duration of time to wait before this instance might poll the persistent store for tasks to run. A value of -1 delays polling until it is started programmatically.

jndiName=JNDI name
jndiName.desc=JNDI name.

pollInterval=Poll interval
pollInterval.desc=Interval between polling for tasks to run. A value of -1 disables all polling after the initial poll.

pollSize=Poll size
pollSize.desc=The maximum number of task entries to find when polling the persistent store for tasks to run. If unspecified, there is no limit.

retryInterval=Retry interval
retryInterval.desc=The amount of time that must pass between the second and subsequent consecutive retries of a failed task.  The first retry occurs immediately, regardless of the value of this attribute.

retryLimit=Retry limit
retryLimit.desc=Limit of consecutive retries for a task that has failed or rolled back, after which the task is considered permanently failed and does not attempt further retries. A value of -1 allows for unlimited retries.
