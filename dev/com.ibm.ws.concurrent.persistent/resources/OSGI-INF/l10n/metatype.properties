# configuration elements

executor=Persistent Scheduled Executor
executor.desc=Schedules and runs persistent tasks.

# ref attributes

contextService=Thread Context Propagation
contextService$Ref=Thread context propagation reference
contextService.desc=Configures how context is captured and propagated to threads.

taskStore=Persistent Task Store
taskStore$Ref=Persistent task store reference
taskStore.desc=Persistent store for scheduled tasks.

# attributes

enableTaskExecution=Enable task execution
enableTaskExecution.desc=Determines whether or not this instance may run tasks.

initialPollDelay=Initial poll delay
initialPollDelay.desc=Duration of time to wait before this instance might poll the persistent store for tasks to run. A value of -1 delays polling until it is started programmatically.

jndiName=JNDI name
jndiName.desc=JNDI name.

missedTaskThreshold=Missed task threshold for fail over
missedTaskThreshold.desc=The amount of time after the expected start of a task run to reserve for running the task. Other members are prevented from running the task before the expiration of this interval. If the interval elapses without the task running successfully, or the task rolls back, then the task run is considered missed, enabling another member to attempt to run it. Missed task threshold values within the supported range of 100 seconds to 9000 seconds (2.5 hours) enable failover.

pollInterval=Poll interval
pollInterval.desc=Interval at which the executor looks for tasks in the persistent store to run. If unspecified and fail over is enabled, a poll interval is automatically computed. If fail over is not enabled, the default is -1, which disables all polling after the initial poll.

pollSize=Poll size
pollSize.desc=The maximum number of task entries to find when polling the persistent store for tasks to run. If unspecified, there is no limit.

retryInterval=Retry interval
retryInterval.desc=The amount of time that must pass between consecutive retries of a failed task. The retry interval applies only when failover is disabled. When failover is enabled, servers retry at their next poll. When failover is not enabled, the first retry occurs immediately on the same server, and at the retry interval thereafter. The default retry interval is 1 minute.

retryLimit=Retry limit
retryLimit.desc=Limit of consecutive retries for a task that has failed or rolled back, after which the task is considered permanently failed and does not attempt further retries. A value of -1 allows for unlimited retries.
