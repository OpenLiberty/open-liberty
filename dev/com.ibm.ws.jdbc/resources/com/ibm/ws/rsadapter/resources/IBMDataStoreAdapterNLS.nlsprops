Tight branch coupling is only supported with type 4 connections to DB2 for z/OS V8 (+ APAR PK47713) or DB2 for Linux, UNIX, Windows V8 and later versions.  The default option of loose branch coupling will be used.  This may cause lock timeouts, deadlocks and/or transaction rollbacks if the application is designed for tight branch coupling since database locks will not be shared across transaction branches within the same global transaction.
TBC_DB_NOT_SUPPORTED.useraction=You must configure the datasource to use a supported level of JDBC driver and database, or configure your application to not require tight branch coupling.

# 0403W      TBC_JCC_NOT_SUPPORTED
#
# {0}        The datasource JNDI name.
TBC_JCC_NOT_SUPPORTED=DSRA0403W: Datasource {0}: does not support tight branch coupling as the DB2 JCC driver is at an incorrect level
TBC_JCC_NOT_SUPPORTED.explanation=The jdbc provider specified by datasource does not support the tight branch coupling option.  Tight branch coupling is only supported with minimum levels of DB2 Universal JCC driver version 3.51 or 3.6, as bundled with DB2 9.5 or 9 service levels, or the JCC4 driver version 4.1.  The default option of loose branch coupling will be used.  This may cause lock timeouts, deadlocks and/or transaction rollbacks if the application is designed for tight branch coupling since database locks will not be shared across transaction branches within the same global transaction.
TBC_JCC_NOT_SUPPORTED.useraction=You must configure the datasource to use a supported level of JDBC driver and database, or configure your application to not require tight branch coupling.

# 8207I      ORA_READONLY
# 
ORA_READONLY=DSRA8207I: Method setReadOnly(false) is ignored. No Oracle transaction will be started.
ORA_READONLY.explanation=Oracle databases do not implement the setReadOnly method. A setReadOnly(true) method will not make the connection as readonly connection. The setReadOnly(false) is also not implemented, and a transaction is implicitly started by an Oracle database. The Application Server will not invoke the setReadOnly(false) method on an Oracle database to prevent an unnecessary transaction from being started.   
ORA_READONLY.useraction=Inspect your application to verify that your application does not depend on a transaction after the setReadOnly(false) method is called.

# 8230W     NONTRAN_DATASOURCE_WARNING
# 
# {0}       The name of the data source property for nontransactional behavior
# {1}       The name of the data source property for configuring commit or rollback on connection cleanup
NONTRAN_DATASOURCE_WARNING=DSRA8230W: The application server is unable to determine if a transaction should be resolved because data source custom property {0} is configured but data source custom property {1} is not configured.
NONTRAN_DATASOURCE_WARNING.explanation=An attempt is made to pool a connection that has an AutoCommit value of False. The application server cannot determine if a transaction is active because the data source is configured as nontransactional. The application server will not attempt to resolve the transaction because the data source is not configured to automatically commit or roll back during connection cleanup.
NONTRAN_DATASOURCE_WARNING.useraction=Configure the data source to automatically commit or roll back on connection cleanup, or always reset the AutoCommit value to True.

MULTITHREADED_ACCESS_DETECTED=DSRA8720W: Detected multithreaded access on {0}.\nLast used with thread id: {1}\nCurrent thread id:        {2}\nStack trace of current thread:{3}
MULTITHREADED_ACCESS_DETECTED.explanation=The application attempted to access a connection or the connection's corresponding Statements, ResultSets, or metadata from a different thread. This behavior is a violation of the programming model for the application server. Closing the objects that the application attempted to access in a finalize() method is also considered a programming model violation, because the finalize() method is run by the JVM in another thread.
MULTITHREADED_ACCESS_DETECTED.useraction=Adjust the application to avoid multithreaded access.

VENDOR_IMPL_NOT_FOUND=DSRA8760W: Unable to locate the implementation for vendor interface {0} after switching to another pooled connection. The unwrapped connection handle is no longer usable as that interface. The new connection implementation class is: {1}
VENDOR_IMPL_NOT_FOUND.explanation=The connection handle is now associated with a pooled connection that is different and that does not implement the interface that is requested for the wrapper.
VENDOR_IMPL_NOT_FOUND.useraction=Wrappers for the interface that is specified should not be used when the Wrapper.isWrapperFor method indicates that the connection is not a wrapper of the interface.

# 8770I      DEFAULT_MATCH_ORIGINAL
# 
# {0}        The name of the connection property.
# {1}        The name of the data source custom property.
DEFAULT_MATCH_ORIGINAL=DSRA8770I: By default, the connection property, {0}, is matched for shareable connections based on the original connection request rather than the current state of the connection. You may use the data source custom property, {1}, to configure this behavior.
DEFAULT_MATCH_ORIGINAL.explanation=The data source custom property allows you to choose which connection sharing behavior you want.
DEFAULT_MATCH_ORIGINAL.useraction=Verify that the data source custom property is configured for the behavior you want.

DSRA8790_SUPPRESS_BEGIN_END_REQUEST=DSRA8790W: The beginRequest and endRequest methods must only be used by connection managers. The JDBC specification does not account for multiple connection managers that can manage a connection. Usage of beginRequest and endRequest by other connection managers is suppressed when connection management is provided by the application server. The following stack indicates the code path on which the beginRequest or endRequest operation was invoked: {0}.
DSRA8790_SUPPRESS_BEGIN_END_REQUEST.explanation=The beginRequest and endRequest hints are suppressed to avoid side effects that interfere with connection management.
DSRA8790_SUPPRESS_BEGIN_END_REQUEST.useraction=To avoid this warning, remove the code that invokes beginRequest and endRequest as identified by the supplied stack.
