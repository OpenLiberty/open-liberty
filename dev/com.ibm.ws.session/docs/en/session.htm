<h1 id="session">WebContainer's Session Component Documentation</h1>

<h2 id="session_overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
The WebContainer's session component bundle provides a very specific implementation of 
http session for the WAS WebContainer component to use. Abstracted as much as possible,
this session component still has a large part of its implementation living in the 
WebContainer bundle. A more generic session component is not available because the dispatcher does not
provide the Servlet interfaces at this point. That may change in the future if we provide more Servlet containers.
</p>
<h2 id="bundle_info">Using this Session Implementation</h2>
<p>
At this time, much of the logic necessary to use this session component is tied deeply into the 
WAS WebContainer component. Therefore, this session implementation requires that 
the component using it extends and implements many classes. Currently, the 
WebContainer implements/extends methods the following classes:</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>HttpSession</li>
<li>SessionContext</li>
<li>HttpSessionFacade</li>
<li>MemoryStore</li>
<li>SessionAffinityManager</li>
<li>SessionContextRegistry</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h2 id="session_storage">Session Storage Support</h2>
<p>
Currently, the only form of session storage supported is in-memory storage.
