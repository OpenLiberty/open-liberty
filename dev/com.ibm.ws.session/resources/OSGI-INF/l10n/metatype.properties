session.config=HTTP Session
session.config.desc=Configuration for HTTP session management.

storage.ref=Storage location
storage.ref.desc=The identifier of the persistent storage location for session data. If no storage location is defined, session data will be stored in the local application server's memory.

SSL.tracking.enabled=Enable SSL identifier tracking
SSL.tracking.enabled.desc=Specifies that session tracking uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) information as a session identifier.

URL.rewriting.enable=Enable URL rewriting
URL.rewriting.enable.desc=Specifies that the session management facility uses rewritten URLs to carry the session identifiers.

protocol.switch.rewriting.enabled=Enable protocol switch rewriting
protocol.switch.rewriting.enabled.desc=Adds the session identifier to a URL when the URL requires a switch from HTTP to HTTPS or from HTTPS to HTTP.

cookies.enabled=Enable cookies
cookies.enabled.desc=Specifies that session tracking uses cookies to carry session identifiers.

cookie.name=Cookie name
cookie.name.desc=A unique name for a session management cookie.

cookie.domain=Cookie domain
cookie.domain.desc=Domain field of a session tracking cookie.

cookie.max.age=Cookie maximum age
cookie.max.age.desc=Maximum amount of time that a cookie can reside on the client browser.

cookie.path=Cookie path
cookie.path.desc=A cookie is sent to the URL designated in the path.

cookie.secure=Restrict cookies to HTTPS sessions
cookie.secure.desc=Specifies that the session cookies include the secure field.

# the word HttpOnly should not be translated
cookie.http.only=Include HttpOnly field in session cookies
cookie.http.only.desc=Specifies that session cookies include the HttpOnly field. Browsers that support the HttpOnly field do not enable cookies to be accessed by client-side scripts. Using the HttpOnly field will help prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

# The word SameSite should not be translated
cookie.same.site=Include a SameSite attribute in session cookies
cookie.same.site.desc=Specifies a SameSite attribute value to use for session cookies.
cookie.same.site.disabled=Do not set a SameSite attribute value on the session cookies
cookie.same.site.lax=Set the session cookie SameSite attribute value to Lax
cookie.same.site.none=Set the session cookie SameSite attribute value to None
cookie.same.site.strict=Set the session cookie SameSite attribute value to Strict

max.in.memory.session.count=Maximum in-memory session count
max.in.memory.session.count.desc=Maximum number of sessions to maintain in memory for each web module.

allow.overflow=Allow session overflow
allow.overflow.desc=Allows the number of sessions in memory to exceed the value of the Max in-memory session count property.

invalidation.timeout=Session timeout
invalidation.timeout.desc=Amount of time a session can go unused before it is no longer valid, in seconds if unit of time isn't specified.

security.integration.enabled=Associate identity of users with HTTP sessions
security.integration.enabled.desc=Enables security integration, which causes the session management facility to associate the identity of users with their HTTP sessions.

id.length=Session identifier length
id.length.desc=Length of the session identifier.

use.context.root.as.cookie.path=Use context root as cookie path
use.context.root.as.cookie.path.desc=Specifies that the cookie path equals the context root of the web module instead of /

# the words response.encodeURL and encodeURL should not be translated
always.encode.url=Always encode URL
always.encode.url.desc=The Servlet 2.5 specification specifies to not encode the URL on a response.encodeURL call if it is not necessary. To support backward compatibility when URL encoding is enabled, set this property to true to call the encodeURL method. The URL is always encoded, even if the browser supports cookies.

clone.id=Clone identifier
clone.id.desc=The clone identifier of the cluster member. Within a cluster, this identifier must be unique to maintain session affinity. When set, this name overwrites the default name generated by the server.

clone.separator=Clone separator
clone.separator.desc=The single character used to separate the session identifier from the clone identifier in session cookies. The default value should usually be used. On some Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) devices, a colon (:) is not allowed, so a plus sign (+) should be used instead. Different values should rarely be used. You should understand the clone character requirements of other products running on your system before using this property to change the clone separator character. The fact that any character can be specified as the value for this property does not imply that the character you specify will function correctly. This fact also does not imply that IBM is responsible for fixing any problem that might arise from using an alternative character.

debug.crossover=Debug crossover
debug.crossover.desc=Enable this option to perform additional checks to verify that only the session associated with the request is accessed or referenced, and log messages if any discrepancies are detected. Disable this option to skip the additional checks.

force.invalidation.multiple=Force invalidation multiple
force.invalidation.multiple.desc=If your requests normally are not bound by a response time limit, specify 0 to indicate that the session manager should wait indefinitely until a request is complete before attempting to invalidate the session. Otherwise, set this property to a positive integer to delay the invalidation of active sessions. Active timed out sessions will not be invalidated by the first invalidation interval pass, but will be invalidated by the interval pass based on this value. For example, a value of 2 would invalidate an active session on the second invalidation interval pass after the session timeout has expired.

id.reuse=Reuse identifier
id.reuse.desc=In a multi-JVM environment that is not configured for session persistence, setting this property to "true" enables the session manager to use the same session information for all of a user's requests even if the web applications that are handling these requests are governed by different JVMs. The default value for this property is false. Set this property to true if you want to enable the session manager to use the session identifier sent from a browser to preserve session data across web applications that are running in an environment that is not configured for session persistence.

no.additional.info=No additional info
no.additional.info.desc=Forces removal of information that is not needed in session identifiers.

reaper.poll.interval=Reaper poll interval
reaper.poll.interval.desc=The wake-up interval, in seconds, for the process that removes invalid sessions. The minimum value is 30 seconds. If a value less than the minimum is entered, an appropriate value is automatically determined and used. This value overrides the default installation value, which is between 30 and 360 seconds, based off the session timeout value. Because the default session timeout is 30 minutes, the reaper interval is usually between 2 and 3 minutes.

rewrite.id=Rewrite identifier
rewrite.id.desc=Use this property to change the key used with URL rewriting.

security.user.ignore.case=Security user ignore case
security.user.ignore.case.desc=Indicates that the session security identity and the client security identity should be considered a match even if their cases are different. For example, when this property is set to true, the session security identity USER1 matches the client security identities User1 and user1.

invalidate.on.unauthorized.session.request.exception=Invalidate sessions requested by invalid users
invalidate.on.unauthorized.session.request.exception.desc=Set this property to true if, in response to an unauthorized request, you want the session manager to invalidate a session instead of issuing an UnauthorizedSessionRequestException. When a session is invalidated, the requester can create a new session, but does not have access to any of the previously saved session data. This allows a single user to continue processing requests to other applications after a logout while still protecting session data.

session.tracking.mechanism.name=Session Tracking Mechanism
session.tracking.mechanism.description=Specifies a mechanism for HTTP session management.

invalidation.name=Invalidation
invalidation.description=Controls how unused sessions are cleaned up.

cookies.name=Cookies
cookies.description=Controls how cookies are used.

url.rewriting.name=URL Rewriting
url.rewriting.description=Controls how URL rewriting is used.

security.name=Security
security.description=Controls how sessions are secured.

failover.name=Failover
failover.description=Controls how sessions are passivated and activated between servers.

advanced.name=Advanced
advanced.description=The default values of these options work for most environments.

extraProperties.name=Additional properties
extraProperties.description=Additional properties related to session management.

modify.active.count.on.invalidated.session.name=Modify active count on invalidated session
modify.active.count.on.invalidated.session.description=Httpsession activeCount metric might become inaccurate when the session is accessed by multiple applications. Set the property to "false" to resolve the issue.

allow.serialized.access.name=Allow serialized access
allow.serialized.access.description=Enable this option to allow serialized access to session data.

max.wait.time.name=Max wait time
max.wait.time.description=The amount of time, in seconds, a servlet waits on a session before it continues execution.

access.on.timeout.name=Access on timeout
access.on.timeout.description=This property gives the servlet access to the session, which allows normal execution even if the session is still locked by another servlet. Set this property to false to stop the servlet execution when the session requests a timeout. The default value is true.
