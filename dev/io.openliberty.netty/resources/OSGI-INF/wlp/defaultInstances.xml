    <!-- The documentation for this variable states that the value here should
         be the fully qualified host name of the system. It should be the name
         of the system that the customer wishes to use, particularly on a
         multi-homed system (multiple NICs, multiple mapped names, etc).
         It should not be set to things like "*", although we have no way to
         enforce that. Also, we do not require configurations reference this
         variable, but its use is encouraged. -->
