 * Split into buckets to enable shorter builds. Notably, Windows on FYRE hardware
 * does not run in under two hours, which is the maximum allowed time for a FAT
 * bucket.
 *
 * Currently split into four buckets. The last time too much time was taken the
 * number of buckets was two. The number has been increased to four to give us
 * extra running room before a new split is necessary.
