#
# USE OF PROPERTIES FILE FOR MESSAGES:
#
# - Each property in the property file is terminated by the line termination character.
# - If a line contains only whitespace or if the first non-whitespace character of a
# line is # or !, the line is ignored. (comments start with # or !)
# - Every line in the properties file other than whitespace lines or comment lines
# denotes a single property. A \ is treated as a line continuation character. Lines
# should be terminated with the line termination character.
# - Correct grammar for a property line is <key><separator><element>. A valid separator
# is any one of equal, colon or whitespace ( =: ).
# - The key consists of all the characters on the line starting from the first
# non-whitespace up to the first separator. Separator characters can be included in the
# key by escaping them (e.g. \:) This is not recommended because it is error prone and
# confusing.
# - Whitespace after the key is skipped until the first non-whitespace character is
# found. All remaining characters up to the appropriate line termination character
# define the element.
#
# MESSAGE INSERTS
#
#  Primitives
# Primitives, such as int and long are not recognized as subclasses of Object
# and cannot be directly passed to one of these methods. A primitive value must
# be transformed to its proper type (e.g Integer, Long) before being passed as
# a parameter.
#
#  Object
# For normal Objects, toString() is called on the object and the resulting String
# is displayed. For exceptions, the stack trace will be printed.For Objects that
# implement the Traceable interface, the toTraceString() method is called instead.
# To provide the proper trace representation for the Object, provide the proper
# implementation for the appropriate method.
#
#  Object[]
# Since Object[] is a proper subclass of Object, Object[] can be passed. Use
# Object[] when more than one parameter should be passed to a message logging
# or trace method. The appropriate method (toString() or toTraceString()) is
# called on each Object in the array. This array should contain only
# standalone normal Objects and should not contain other arrays. Passing nested
# array may result in the following Strings being displayed :
#  "[B@924586a0b" - This is deciphered as a byte array at location X.
# This is typically returned when an array of primitives is passed as a member
# of an Object[]. It is the result of calling toString() on the byte[].
#  "[Ljava.lang.Object;@9136fa0b" : An array of objects.
# Typically this is seen when an array containing nested arrays is passed.
#
#  Array of Primitives
# An array of primitive (e.g. byte[], int[] is recognized as an Object, but is
# treated somewhat as a second cousin of Object by Java. The results you see
# will depend on the type of array passed and the API used. For consistent results,
# user code should preprocess and format the primitive array into some type of
# String form before passing it to the method. If such preprocessing is not
# performed, you may see something results something like the following:
#  "Illegal trace argument : array of long."
# This is typically returned when an array of primitives is passed to a method
# taking an Object and the Tr service does not provide special parsing for
# primitive arrays of this type.
#  "01040703..." : the hex representation of an array of bytes.
# Typically this may be seen when a byte array is passed to a method taking a
# single Object. This behavior is subject to change and should not be relied on.
#  " '1' '2' ..." : The String representation of the members of an int[] formed
# by converting each element to an Integer and calling toString on the Integers.
# This behavior is subject to change and should not be relied on.

#  Common messages
# The following common messages are used in this file:
#
#         CMSG0001       This is an unexpected exception. The cause can not be immediately determined. 
#         CMSG0002       For further information on resolving this error, please consult the IBM WebSphere Application Server Support website available
#                        at: http://www-3.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html. The site provides searchable databases of technotes,
#                        solutions, and e-fixes. Information on contacting the WebSphere Support team is also provided.

#
# Translator Instructions:
#
# The messages to be translated are contained in key/text pairs and
# contains three parts:
#
# 1) A key (a text string) which is an identifier used by the code to
#    retrieve data.  This is required - and SHOULD NOT be translated.
# 2) A equals ("=") sign separating the key and text.  This is required.
# 3) A string containing data that will be displayed to
#    the user when running the application.  This is required and
#    SHOULD be translated.
#
# In short, each line in the resource array contains two strings.
# The SECOND quoted string on each line should be translated.
#
# Some of the strings to be translated contain special codes
# for data that will be inserted into the string when the string
# is displayed to the user.  For example, say you have the
# following string to translate:
#
#   This file was written by the IBM Administrator on {0,date}.
#
# {0,date} is a code that tells Java to insert a parameter into
# this space when displaying it to the user.  In this case,
# the parameter that is inserted is a date.
#
# The 0 indicates that this is where the first parameter is
# inserted in the string.  There may be more than one parameter
# in any one string.  The 'date' tells java to format this
# parameter as a date.
#
# The {0,date} code should be placed at the appropriate position
# in the translated text.  Please note that the code in the
# translation must match exactly the code in the original
# string.
#
# The developer should describe in comments above the string to be
# translated each of the parameters so that you will be able to
# determine where the best location for each parameter in the
# translated string.
#
# Lines that begin with a pound sign (#) are comments and should not be
# translated.

WTRN0128_WSTX_APP_START_FAILURE.explanation=The application is configured with a WebService policy specifying WS Transaction specifications which are not supported on all servers in the cluster.  Application requests or their recovery may be directed to any server in the cluster so all applications must use features which are supported on all servers.
WTRN0128_WSTX_APP_START_FAILURE.useraction=Uninstall the application or modify the WS Transaction policy configuration for the application to use supported features.  Alternatively, upgrade all the nodes in the cluster to release 7.0 or later.

WTRN0129_WSTX_APP_START_FAILURE=WTRN0129W: The default setting for WS Transaction specification level is inappropriate for a mixed version cluster
WTRN0129_WSTX_APP_START_FAILURE.explanation=The configured WS Transaction specification level default setting for the server may cause execution problems as all servers in the cluster are not at the same release of the Application Server.  All servers in the cluster need to support the same specification level since application requests or their recovery may be directed to any server.  If servers support different specification levels, then the application behaviour may change depending on which server it executes.
