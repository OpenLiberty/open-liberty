#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFLICTING_ANNOTATION_VALUES_CWNEN0054E=CWNEN0054E: The {0} bean in the {1} module of the {2} application has conflicting configuration data in source code annotations. Conflicting {3} attribute values exist for multiple {4} annotations with the same {5} attribute value : {6}. The conflicting {3} attribute values are {7} and {8}.
CONFLICTING_ANNOTATION_VALUES_CWNEN0054E.explanation=When multiple resource references are defined in source code annotations for the same component namespace with the same name, all attributes of the resource must either be the same, or one must be assignable to the other.
CONFLICTING_ANNOTATION_VALUES_CWNEN0054E.useraction=In the source code annotations, change the name of one of the resource references, or change one of the conflicting values so they are the same value or one is assignable to the other.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MSG_DEST_NOT_FOUND_ON_NODE_CWNEN0055E=CWNEN0055E: The {0} message destination in the {1} module of the {2} application cannot be found on this node.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INJECTION_DECLARED_IN_BOTH_THE_FIELD_AND_METHOD_OF_A_BEAN_CWNEN0056E=CWNEN0056E: Injection of the {0} resource was specified for both a property instance variable and its corresponding set method on the {1} class in the {2} module of the {3} application.
INJECTION_DECLARED_IN_BOTH_THE_FIELD_AND_METHOD_OF_A_BEAN_CWNEN0056E.explanation=Requesting injection of a resource into both a property instance variable and its corresponding set method is an error.
INJECTION_DECLARED_IN_BOTH_THE_FIELD_AND_METHOD_OF_A_BEAN_CWNEN0056E.useraction=Remove one of the annotations from either the field or method.  Either the field or the method could request injection of a resource of a different (non-default) name. By explicitly specifying the JNDI name of a resource, a single resource may be injected into multiple fields or methods of multiple classes.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INJECTION_TARGET_MUST_NOT_BE_STATIC_CWNEN0057W=CWNEN0057W: The {0}.{1} injection target must not be declared static.

If this class is an interceptor or Web service handler class that is used by multiple beans, some of which are configured for bean-managed transactions and others which are not, then create a new interceptor or Web service handler class that does not inject a UserTransaction instance and use it with the beans that are configured for container-managed transactions.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AMBIGUOUS_INJECTION_METHODS_CWNEN0061E=CWNEN0061E: The {0} injection target property name for the {1} reference is ambiguous in the {2} class.  The {3} method and the {4} method are both type compatible with the {5} type.
AMBIGUOUS_INJECTION_METHODS_CWNEN0061E.explanation=The class was configured to have method injection, but multiple methods are compatible with the type of the object to be injected.
AMBIGUOUS_INJECTION_METHODS_CWNEN0061E.useraction=Change the bean configuration to specify the exact type of one of the methods, change the class to have a method with a parameter type that is exactly the same as the type of the injection configuration, or change the class by removing or renaming one of the ambiguous methods.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFLICTING_REFERENCES_CWNEN0062E=CWNEN0062E: The {0} component and the {1} component in the {2} module of the {3} application have conflicting values for the {4} property of the {5} reference.  The conflicting values are {6} and {7}.
CONFLICTING_REFERENCES_CWNEN0062E.explanation=When a reference with the same name is defined by several components that share a component namespace, all binding and extension properties of the reference must be the same.

INJECTION_METHOD_MUST_HAVE_ONE_PARAM_CWNEN0069E.useraction=Either change the code for the injection method to have exactly one parameter, choose a different injection target, or remove the injection target and populate the value manually.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INCOMPATIBLE_ANNOTATION_CLASS_CWNEN0070W=CWNEN0070W: The {0} annotation class will not be recognized because it was loaded from the {1} location rather than from a product class loader.
INCOMPATIBLE_ANNOTATION_CLASS_CWNEN0070W.explanation=The application class loader or an application server class loader has loaded an annotation class that should have been loaded by a product class loader. This occurs when a class loader has been configured to load classes with the local class loader first (parent last). The annotation will only be recognized if it is loaded by a product class loader.
INCOMPATIBLE_ANNOTATION_CLASS_CWNEN0070W.useraction=Remove the annotation class from the application or application server class path.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INVALID_OBJECT_FACTORY_ATTRIBUTE_CWNEN0071E=CWNEN0071E: The {0} reference for the {1} component in the {2} module in the {3} application has the {4} type and a value for the {5} attribute that is not valid: {6}
