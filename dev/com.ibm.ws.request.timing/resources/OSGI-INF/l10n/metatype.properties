requestTiming.name=Request Timing
requestTiming.desc=Provides warnings and diagnostic information for the slow or hung requests.

slowRequestThreshold=Slow request threshold
slowRequestThreshold.desc=Duration of time that a request can run before being considered slow.

hungRequestThreshold=Hung request threshold
hungRequestThreshold.desc=Duration of time that a request can run before being considered hung.

sampleRate=Sampling rate
sampleRate.desc=Rate at which the sampling should happen for the slow request tracking.  To sample one out of every n requests, set sampleRate to n.  To sample all requests, set sampleRate to 1.

includeContextInfo=Include context information
includeContextInfo.desc=Indicates if the context information details are included in the log output.

timing.name=Timing
timing.desc=Overrides defaults that are specified in the root attributes of requestTiming for specific types.

eventType=Event type
eventType.desc=Event type for which the attributes must be applied. Overrides root attributes of requestTiming.

contextInfoPattern=Context information pattern
contextInfoPattern.desc=The pattern that determines whether this timing element processes a request. To discover the context information for a request, enable the eventLogging-1.0 service and view the events generated for the request. To add a wildcard, put an asterisk at the end of the pattern. If a context information pattern is used, the request timing configuration must set includeContextInfo to true.

interruptHungRequest=Interrupt hung requests
interruptHungRequest.desc=Indicates whether a request that is hung is to be interrupted. A value of true causes the requestTiming-1.0 feature to attempt to interrupt the hung request. A value of false allows the request to continue to run.
