# open-liberty jakarta configuration for bundle identity updates.
#
# These are used to perform bundle ID reassignment.
#
# Last update: 23-Jun-2020
#
# Format:
# bundle-id-selector=bundle-id-reassignment-data
#
# The bundle-id-select is either an exact bundle ID, or is the wildcard '*', which
# matches all bundle IDs.  Matches are performed against exact bundle IDs before
# matching the wildcard.
#
# Bundle ID reassignment is performed on manifest (MANIFEST.MF) and feature manifest
# (feature-name.mf) files.
#
# Reassignment is performed on the four bundle identity properties:
#   "Bundle-SymbolicName"
#   "Bundle-Version"
#   "Bundle-Name"
#   "Bundle-Description"
#
# The bundle ID reassignment data supplies replacement values for these properties
# as a comma (',') delimited list, in the format:
#
#  (new-symbolic-name,new-bundle-version,new-bundle-name,new-bundle-description)
#
# A leading '*' on the reassignment bundle symbolic name means that the new bundle-id
# value is to be appended to the current bundle ID.
#
# The new bundle version is used as given.
#
# A leading '+' on the reassignment bundle name means that the bundle name will be updated
# by appending the supplied name.  Otherwise, the new bundle name is used as given.
#
# A leading '+' on the reassignment bundle description means that the bundle description will
# be updated by appending the supplied description.  Otherwise, the new bundle description is
# used as given.
#
# Double quotes ('"') may be placed around the new bundle name and new bundle description
# values.
