# The format of properties in this file matches one of the following forms:
#   <class name>               = <permission>
#   <class name>               = <validation mode>
#   <class name>               = <permission>, <validation mode>
#   <class name>#<method name> = <permission>
# where the following names may be used in the property value:
#   validation modes: INACTIVE, DISCOVER, ENFORCE, REJECT
#   permissions: ALLOW, DENY
#
# In addition, the property key may use an asterisk '*' as the final character
# to indicate that it is a prefix and should match any class (or class#method)
# string that starts with that prefix.

# Use the wildcard character on its own to specify the default behaviour.
# set the default validation mode and permission
# note: any other settings with a more specific key can override these values
