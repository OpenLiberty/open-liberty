# All of the sub bundles inherit the following settings.  The gradle logic
# currently doesn't look at sub bundles for the the following two properties
# and only looks at the parent bnd settings.  
# Bnd logic only looks at the buildpath from the parent bnd file for all
# sub bundles. Also need to add -maven-dependencies: properties in the subbundles to pickup the included OSS libs.
