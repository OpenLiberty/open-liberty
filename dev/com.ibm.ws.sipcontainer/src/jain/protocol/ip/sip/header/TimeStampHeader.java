 * This interface represents the Timestamp general-header.
 * The TimeStampHeader describes when the client sent the
 * Request to the server. The value of the timestamp
 * is of significance only to the client and it may use any
 * timescale. The server must echo the exact same value and
 * may, if it has accurate information about this, add a
 * floating point number indicating the number of seconds
 * that have elapsed since it has received the Request.
 * The TimestampHeader is used by the client to compute the
 * round-trip time to the server so that it can adjust the
 * timeout value for retransmissions.
