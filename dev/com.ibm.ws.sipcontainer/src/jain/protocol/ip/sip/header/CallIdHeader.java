/**
 * <p>
 * This interface represents the Call-ID general-header.
 * CallIdHeader uniquely identifies a particular
 * invitation or all registrations of a particular client. Note that a
 * single multimedia conference can give rise to several calls with
 * different Call-IDs, e.g., if a user invites a single individual
 * several times to the same (long-running) conference.
 * </p><p>
 * For an INVITE Request, a callee user agent server should not alert
 * the user if the user has responded previously to the Call-ID in the
 * INVITE Request. If the user is already a member of the conference and
 * the conference parameters contained in the session description have
 * not changed, a callee user agent server may  silently accept the call,
 * regardless of the Call-ID. An invitation for an existing Call-ID or
 * session can change the parameters of the conference. A client
 * application MAY decide to simply indicate to the user that the
 * conference parameters have been changed and accept the invitation
 * automatically or it may require user confirmation.
 * </p><p>
 * A user may be invited to the same conference or call using several
 * different CallIdHeaders. If desired, the client may use identifiers within
 * the session description to detect this duplication. For example, SDP
 * contains a session id and version number in the origin (o) field.
 * </p><p>
 * The REGISTER and OPTIONS Requests use the CallIdHeader to
 * unambiguously match Requests and Responses. All REGISTER Requests
 * issued by a single client should use the same CallIdHeader, at least
 * within the same boot cycle.
