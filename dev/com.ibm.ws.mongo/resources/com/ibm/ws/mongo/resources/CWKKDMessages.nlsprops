CWKKD0017.ssl.incompatible.driver=CWKKD0017E: The {0} service with id {1} encountered an incompatible version of the MongoDB driver at shared library {2}. For SSL a minimum level of {3} is required, but the service found {4}.
CWKKD0017.ssl.incompatible.driver.explanation=The MongoDB service was provided with an invalid driver library for use with SSL.
CWKKD0017.ssl.incompatible.driver.useraction=Update the shared library with a supported level.

# Do not translate "useCertificateAuthentication", "user" and "password"
CWKKD0018.ssl.user.pswd.certificate=CWKKD0018E: The {0} service with id {1} encountered an incompatible combination of authentication options. useCertificateAuthentication is incompatible with user and password.

CWKKD0020.ssl.get.certificate.user=CWKKD0020E: The {0} service with id {1} received an exception while reading the client key and certificate from the provided keystore.   Nested exception is {2}
CWKKD0020.ssl.get.certificate.user.explanation=The MongoDB service tried to read the client key and certificate from the keystore, and encountered a problem with the keystore or with a certificate in it.  
CWKKD0020.ssl.get.certificate.user.useraction=The nested exception should provide more information.

CWKKD0023.ssl.certauth.incompatible.driver=CWKKD0023E: The {0} service with id {1} encountered an incompatible version of the MongoDB driver at shared library {2}. For certificate authentication, a minimum level of {3} is required, but the service found level {4}.
