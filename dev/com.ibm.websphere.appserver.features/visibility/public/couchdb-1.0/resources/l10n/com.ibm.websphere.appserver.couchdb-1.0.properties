description=This feature has been stabilized. \
The strategic alternative to this feature is the cloudant-1.0 feature. \
This feature enables connections to CouchDB by providing a connector instance configured \
 in the server configuration, which can be injected or accessed through JNDI.  Applications use the \
 ektorp client library to utilize the connector instance to work with CouchDB.
