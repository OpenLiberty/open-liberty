description=A secure, REST administrative connector that can be used locally or remotely using any Java \
developer kit. This connector enables remote access from a Java client or directly through an HTTPS call. \
The administrator and reader roles protect the connector. The connector requires TLS to keep the communication confidential. \
The HTTPS port used by the connector is defined through the default HTTP endpoint. This feature supersedes \
the restConnector-1.0 feature. It enables the REST handler configuration APIs. When this feature is combined \
with features supporting configuration validation, the corresponding REST handler validation APIs are enabled.
