description=A secure, REST administrative connector that can be used locally or remotely using any Java \
developer kit. This connector enables remote access from a Java client or directly through an HTTPS call. \
It is protected by a single administrator role and requires SSL to keep the communication confidential. \
The HTTPS port used by the connector is defined through the default HTTP endpoint. This feature supersedes \
the restConnector-1.0 feature and does not include the jaxrs-1.1 feature.
