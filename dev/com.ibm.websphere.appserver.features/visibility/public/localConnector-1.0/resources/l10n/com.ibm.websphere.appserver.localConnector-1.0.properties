description=This feature allows the use of a local JMX connector that is built into the JVM to access \
 JMX resources in the server. The JMX connector can only be used on the same host machine by a client \
 that has the same user ID and the same JDK as the server process. It enables local access by JMX \
 clients such as jConsole, or other JMX clients that use the Attach API.
