description=Social login is a form of single sign-on (SSO) that enables users to sign in to a \
secured website by using their existing social media account instead of creating an account \
specifically for the website. For example, you can configure social login so that users \
can log in to your website with their Facebook or Twitter accounts. \
You can enable social login for any social media platform that uses \
the OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect 1.0 standard for authorization. \
It can be used instead of, or in addition to, the configured user registry.
