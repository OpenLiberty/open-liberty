description=This feature has been stabilized. \
The strategic alternative to this feature is described at https://openliberty.io/blog/2019/02/19/mongodb-with-open-liberty.html. \
This feature enables the usage of the MongoDB Java Driver and allows DB instances to be \
configured in the server configuration, injected into managed components such as EJBs, and accessed \
through JNDI. Applications interact with these DB instances via the MongoDB APIs
