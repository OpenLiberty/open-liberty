description=The Liberty Audit feature is used to report and track auditable events to ensure the integrity of your system. \
The Liberty Audit feature introduces an infrastructure which serves two purposes: \
 - Confirming the effectiveness and integrity of the existing configuration \
 - Identifying areas where improvement to the configuration may be needed  \
The Liberty Audit feature has the ability to capture the following auditable events: \
 - Basic authentication \
 - Start and stop of the Audit service \
 - Form login \
 - Client certificate login \
 - Servlet runAs delegation \
 - Form logout \
 - Servlet 3.0 login, logout and authenticate APIs \
The Liberty Audit feature supports the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) event model.  The CADF model describes a data model and associated schema definitions for an audit event. \
The feature provides a default implementation, the AuditFileHandler, which emits human-readable audit records to a file-based log.   Each audit record is emitted in JSON format. \
