#==== BASIC REGISTYR CONFIGURATION ====
basic.config=Basic User Registry
basic.config.desc=A simple XML-based user registry.

realm=Realm name
realm.desc=The realm name represents the user registry.

ignoreCaseForAuthentication=Case-insensitive authentication
ignoreCaseForAuthentication.desc=Allow case-insensitive user name authentication.

#==== BASIC USER ENTRY ====
basic.user=User
basic.user.desc=A user in a Basic User Registry.

user.name=User name
user.name.desc=Name of a user in a Basic User Registry.

user.password=Password
user.password.desc=Password of a user in a Basic User Registry. The value can be stored in clear text or encoded form. It is recommended that you encode the password. To do so, use the securityUtility tool with the encode option.

#==== BASIC GROUP ENTRY ====
basic.group=Group
basic.group.desc=A group in a Basic User Registry.

group.name=Group name
group.name.desc=Name of a group in a Basic User Registry.

#==== BASIC GROUP MEMBER ENTRY ====
basic.group.member=Group Member
basic.group.member.desc=A member of a Basic User Registry group.

member.name=User name
member.name.desc=Name of a user in a Basic User Registry group.

#==== BASIC X.509 CERTIFICATE MAPPING ====
certificate.map.mode=Certificate map mode
certificate.map.mode.desc=Specifies the X.509 certificate authentication mapping mode for the basic registry: DISABLED, PRINCIPAL_CN, or CUSTOM.

certificate.mapper.id=CertificateMapper ID
certificate.mapper.id.desc=Specifies the CertificateMapper ID to use when the X.509 certificate authentication mapping mode is CUSTOM

certificate.map.mode.principal_cn=The basic registry attempts to authenticate the X.509 certificate by mapping the PrincipalName value in the X.509 certificate to the exact distinguished name (DN) in the repository. If a single matching entity is found, the authentication is successful. If a matching entity is not found or more than a single matching entity is found, authentication fails and the program returns an error.
certificate.map.mode.custom=The basic registry attempts to authenticate the X.509 certificate by using the custom CertificateMapper implementation specified by certificateMapperId. If a single matching entity is found, the authentication is successful. If a matching entity is not found or more than a single matching entity is found, authentication fails and the program returns an error.
