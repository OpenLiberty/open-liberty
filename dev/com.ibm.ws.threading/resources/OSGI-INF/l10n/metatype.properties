executor.service.name=Executor Management
executor.service.desc=Defines settings for the Liberty kernel default executor.  Note that there is always one and exactly one default executor, for use by the Liberty runtime only and not directly accessible by applications.  Applications that need to configure and utilize executors should instead use Managed Executors.

name=Name
name.desc=The name of the Liberty kernel default executor.

core.threads=Core threads
core.threads.desc=Steady-state or core number of threads to associate with the executor. The number of threads associated with the executor will quickly grow to this number. If this value is less than 0, a default value is used. This default value is calculated based on the number of hardware threads on the system.

max.threads=Maximum threads
max.threads.desc=Maximum number of threads that can be associated with the executor. If greater than 0, this value must be greater than or equal to the value of coreThreads. If the value of maxThreads is less than or equal to 0, the maximum number of threads is unbounded.  Note that the actual number of threads associated with the executor is determined dynamically by the Liberty kernel, so leaving the maximum threads unbounded does not imply that the runtime will actively create large amounts of threads; it simply lets the Liberty kernel decide how many threads to associate with the executor without having a defined upper boundary.
