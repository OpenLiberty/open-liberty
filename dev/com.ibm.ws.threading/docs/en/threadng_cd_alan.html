<h1 id="Threading_CDD">Conceptual Design of Threading Package</h1>
<h2 id="Threading base structure">Basic Object Layout</h2>
<p>The basic concept of the threading support included in the Liberty product is to centralize the management of the 
threading infrastructure.  In classic WAS,  threads were handed out to components and were not returned until the 
server terminated.  There were also many different pools of threads, and no clear relationship between the various 
thread pools, so tuning the server for different multi-programming levels was a difficult exercise and as such the 
system never really ran optimally
</p>
<p>The basic structures in the threading package breaks down into 4 objects.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>WorkRequestMgr</b> This is the service that is registered with OSGi, and is the anchor for all
the functions that are used in the threading package.
<li><b>WorkRequestStage</b>  This is logically a queue, where the request of work places workrequests 
that need to be run within the server.  The actually implementation of the WorkRequestStage will not 
be a simple as a queue, but that is the semantic that is presented to the caller.  There then is a set 
of executors that take work from the queue and execute it.</li>
<li><b>WorkRequest</b>  This is the control structure, that represents the piece of work that is 
going to be run by the stage.</li>
<li><b>WorkRequestRunnable</b>  The work request runnable is the actual piece of code that is going to be 
dispatched.  It is associated with the Workrequest, and there can be more than one WorkrequestRunnable 
associated with the workrequest.  Each is considered independent of one another.  And this point they run 
sequentially, but there will be an options for multiple scheduling structures, for example a fanout request 
that allows for the runnables to be called in parallel.</li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Internally there are some subclasses of WorkRequest knows as a WorkControlRequest.  These are used to control
the executor threads that are associated with the WorkRequestStage.  These control requests get queued directly
to the thread and their purpose in live is to perform control functions within this threading framework.
</p>
<p>This is a picture of the relationships of the various control structures (green boxes are available outside the bundle):</p>

<h2>Configuration information</h2>
<h2>Startup of the Stage</h2>
<p>The startup of a stage is fairly simple, the stage object initializes itself, ensuring the queue starts empty.  It 
reads from the configuration what the Multi-programming Level is, in the current code this means the number of 
threads that are to be started.  Executor threads are started at this time, and they start looking on the queue for 
work to perform.  If there is no work,  the thread waits until work is added to the queue.  Once this is done, all 
threads are waken, and they race to the queue.
</p>
<h2>Shutdown of the Stage</h2>
<p>
There are two forms of shutdown, an immediate shutdown and a quiesce.  In both cases, the stage stops accepting new work, any
attempt to queue new work will be met with an exception telling the caller that the stage is in a shutdown mode.
</p>
<h2>Adjusting the multiprogramming level of the stage</h2>
<h2>Synchronization within the framework</h2>
<p>To be added, once complete</p>
<h2>Monitoring within the stage</h2>
<p>To be added, once complete</p>
<h2>Platform uniqueness</h2>
<p>None</p>
