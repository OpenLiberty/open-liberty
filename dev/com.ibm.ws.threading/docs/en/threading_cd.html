<title>Liberty Threading Conceptual Design</title>

<h1>Conceptual Design of Threading Package</h1>

<p>
There are basically three efforts that have influenced the Liberty
threading package.  The overall concept is that the execution framework we
deliver should be able to support a pipelined execution strategy, a fork/join
programming model, and employ work-stealing within the scheduler.
</p>

<h2>Intel Threading Building Blocks</h2>

<p>
Intel TBB is a C++ template library that provides a set of concurrent
containers, a task scheduler, and infrastructure to support the creation of
scalable, parallel applications. 
</p>
<p>
The scheduler implemented by TBB employs a work stealing model on top of
a managed thread pool.  The thread pool is generally sized such that there
is one thread per hardware thread and is expected to run largely compute-bound
work.
</p>
<p>
TBB has first class support for pipline execution models as well as a fork/join
decomposition model.  TBB also provides direct access to the scheduler to
implement custom policies.

<h2>Staged Event Driven Architecture</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/proj/seda/" class="externalURL">
The Staged Event Driven Architecture</a> (SEDA) describes a server
architecture where the flow of work through a system as a pipeline of
<em>work stages</em> connected by queues.  Each stage hosts an event handler
that processes a stream of similar events.
</p>
<p>
Within a stage, a controller works to throttle the amount of work coming in
to avoid overloading the system.  Another controller attempts to adjust the
execution characteristics of the stage to provide optimal throughput for the
stage.
</p>
<p>
While not fully implemented, the threading package is structured such that
all work stages (backed by a shared or dedicated <code>ExecutorService</code>)
can be controlled and monitored.  The characteristics of the stages will be
adjusted at runtime in an attempt to provide the best overall throughput for
the system.
</p>
<p>
The Liberty Event Engine is capable of associating event topics with a named
work stage.  The idea is that mapping mainline event topics to stages will
allow us to implement a SEDA-style architecture if we choose to.  If, instead
of a SEDA-style implementation we prefer to process all events on the thread
that fires them, we can map events to a single stage.  If we're looking for
mostly single threaded behavior but with load balancing, we can use work stealing
to process independent events when the system has free cycles.
</p>

<h2>JSR 166y</h2>
<p>
The <code>java.util.concurrent</code> packages introduced with Java 5
have generated follow on efforts known as JSR 166x, JSR 166y, and JSR 166z.
</p>
<p>
JSR 166y, planned for Java 7, introduces implementations that support
fork-join style parallel programming.  This style of programming works to
decompose the processing of a data set into smaller chunks that can be
scheduled to run in parallel.  By implementing a work-stealing style
<code>ExecutorService</code> in Liberty, it should be possible to either
reuse our implementation or replace it with what comes out with the JDK.
