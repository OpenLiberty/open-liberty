 * Components with server configuration should instead rely on policyExecutor
 * instances from server config, which is the preferred approach, rather than
 * using PolicyExecutorProvider.</p>
 *
 * <p>Policy executors are backed by the Liberty global thread pool,
 * but allow concurrency constraints and various queue attributes
 * to be controlled independently of the global thread pool.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example, to create a policy executor that allows at most 3 tasks to
 * be active at any given point and can queue up to 20 tasks,</p>
 *
 * <code>
 * executor = PolicyExecutorProvider.create("AtMost3ConcurrentPolicy").maxConcurrency(3).maxQueueSize(20);
