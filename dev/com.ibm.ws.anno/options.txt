Caching Options:

From:
  open-liberty/dev/com.ibm.ws.anno/src/com/ibm/wsspi/anno/targets/cache/TargetCache_Options.java

  String DISABLED_PROPERTY_NAME = "anno.cache.disabled"; // Default: [false]
  -- Disable use of the annotations cache.  Regardless if whether any cache
     files are present, don't use them.  Always do fresh scans.
  -- Used when writes are not allowed.
  String DIR_PROPERTY_NAME = "anno.cache.dir"; // Default: ["anno"]
  -- Optional directory override for the annotations cache.
  -- For testing only.
  String READ_ONLY_PROPERTY_NAME = "anno.cache.readOnly"; // Default: [false]
  -- Disable writes to the annotations cache.  Existing cache data will
     be read, but new or invalidated data will not be overwritten.
  -- Used when *new* writes are not allowed, but pre-cached
     data is available and should be read. 
  String ALWAYS_VALID_PROPERTY_NAME = "anno.cache.alwaysValid"; // Default: [false]
  -- Disables validity checking.  All cached data is assumed to be valid, and
     is used without any timestamp or size checking.  This setting applies to
     locations which are usually considered invalid, such as loose containers
     and directories.
//  String VALIDATE_PROPERTY_NAME = "anno.cache.validate"; // Default: [false]
//  -- Always rescan, even if cache data is available, and compare the cache data
//     with the new scan results.  Generate error trace for any differences.
//  -- For testing only.
//  -- VALIDATE is not currently implemented.
  String WRITE_THREADS_PROPERTY_NAME = "anno.cache.writeThreads"; // Default: [8]
  -- Controls the number of write threads.  If set to 1, writes are performed
     synchronously.  If set to -1, an unlimited number of write threads is allowed.
     Write thread pooling is per application.

Scanning Options:

From:
  open-liberty/dev/com.ibm.ws.anno/src/com/ibm/wsspi/anno/classsource/ClassSource_Options.java

  String JANDEX_ENABLE_PROPERTY_NAME = "com.ibm.ws.jandex.enable"; // Default: [false]
  -- Controls whether Jandex indexes are read.
  -- An alternate to setting configuration properties.
  -- For testing only.
  String JANDEX_ENABLE_FULL_PROPERTY_NAME = "com.ibm.ws.jandex.enable.full"; // Default: [false]
  -- Controls whether full Jandex reads are performed.
  -- By default, Jandex reads are custom and retain in memory a sparse subset of
     the entire data of Jandex indexes.
  -- For testing only.
  String JANDEX_PATH_PROPERTY_NAME = "com.ibm.ws.jandex.path"; // Default: ["META-INF/jandex.idx"]
  -- The path to Jandex index files.  This is relative to the root of the archive.
  -- For testing only.
  String ANNO_SCAN_THREADS_PROPERTY_NAME = "com.ibm.ws.anno.scan.threads"; // Default: [8]
  -- Controls the number of threads used for scanning independent class path components.
  -- If set to 1, scans are performed synchronously.
  -- If set to -1, an unlimited number of write threads is allowed.
  -- Scan threads pooling is per module.
