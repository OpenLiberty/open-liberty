Annotation Scanning Options:
  -- These options apply regardless of the options set for annotation caching.
  -- These options control how annotation scanning is performed, regardless of
     whether or how the results are cached.

  JANDEX_ENABLE_PROPERTY_NAME = "com.ibm.ws.jandex.enable"
  -- Values: [ true | false ]
  -- Default: [ false ]
  -- Controls whether Jandex indexes are read.
  -- An alternate to setting configuration properties.

  ANNO_SCAN_THREADS_PROPERTY_NAME = "com.ibm.ws.anno.scan.threads"
  -- Values: [ -1 | 0 | 1..64 ]
  -- Default: [ 8 ]
  -- Controls the number of threads used for scanning independent class path components.
  -- If set to 1, scans are performed synchronously.
  -- If set to -1, the maximum write threads (up to 64) is allowed.
  -- Scan thread pooling is per module.

Annotation Caching Options:
  -- These options are independent of the annotation scanning options.
  -- These options control how the annotation scan data is managed, regardless
     of how the scan data was initially obtained.

  DISABLED_PROPERTY_NAME = "anno.cache.disabled"
  -- Values: [ true | false ]
  -- Default: [ false ]
  -- Disable use of the annotations cache.  Regardless if whether any cache
     files are present, don't use them.  Always do fresh scans.
  -- Does not disable multi-threaded scans.

  DIR_PROPERTY_NAME = "anno.cache.dir";
  -- Values: Valid absolute or relative path
  -- Default: [ "anno" ]
  -- Optional directory override for the annotations cache.

  READ_ONLY_PROPERTY_NAME = "anno.cache.readOnly"
  -- Values: [ true | false ]
  -- Default: [ false ]
  -- Disable writes to the annotations cache.  Existing cache data will
     be read, but new or invalidated data will not be overwritten.
  -- Used when *new* writes are not allowed, but pre-cached
     data is available and should be read. 

  ALWAYS_VALID_PROPERTY_NAME = "anno.cache.alwaysValid"
  -- Values: [ true | false ]
  -- Default: [ false ]
  -- Disables validity checking.  All cached data is assumed to be valid, and
     is used without any timestamp or size checking.  This setting applies to
     locations which are usually considered invalid, such as loose containers
     and directories.

  WRITE_THREADS_PROPERTY_NAME = "anno.cache.writeThreads";
  -- Values: [ -1 | 0 | 1..64 ]
  -- Default: [ 8 ]
  -- Controls the number of write threads.  If set to 1, writes are performed
     synchronously.  If set to -1, an unlimited number of write threads is allowed.
     Write thread pooling is per application.
