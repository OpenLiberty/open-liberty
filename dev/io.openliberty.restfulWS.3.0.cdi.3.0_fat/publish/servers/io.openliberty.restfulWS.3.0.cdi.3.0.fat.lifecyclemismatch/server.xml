<!-- Added to allow EE10 to work as-is.  In EE10 the CDI "bean-discovery-mode" was switched from
     "all" to "annotated" which requires all CDI managed classes to contain a Bean Defining Annotation.
     Some tests have been changed to account for this while others have had this property
     added so both scenarios are tested. -->
