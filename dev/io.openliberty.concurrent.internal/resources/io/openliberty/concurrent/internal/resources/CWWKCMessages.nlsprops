# All messages must use the range CWWCK1200 to CWWCK1409

CWWKC1200.resource.unavailable=CWWKC1200E: {0}, which is defined by application {1}, was not available in a timely manner.
CWWKC1200.resource.unavailable.explanation=Too much load on the system to process resource definition annotations and deployment descriptor entries before the application attempts to use them.
CWWKC1200.resource.unavailable.useraction=View the messages.log file to identify the occurrence of an error. Otherwise, reduce the load on the system.

CWWKC1201.contextsvc.inaccessible=CWWKC1201E: {0}, which is defined by application {1}, requires a ContextService {2} but the ContextService was inaccessible or not available in a timely manner.
CWWKC1201.contextsvc.inaccessible.explanation=The specified resource that implements the ContextService interface was inaccessible or not available because of any of the following reasons. 1.) A resource definition annotation or a resource definition in a deployment descriptor of the application specifies an incorrect JNDI name at which to find the resource that implements the ContextService interface. 2.) The resource that implements the ContextService interface is defined in a scope that is not accessible to the resource that requires the resource that implements the ContextService interface. 3.) The system is under too much load to register a resource that implements the ContextService interface in a timely manner.
CWWKC1201.contextsvc.inaccessible.useraction=Correct the application to refer to the JNDI name of the ContextService that is accessible. If the specified JNDI name is correct, reduce the load on the system.

CWWKC1202.context.lists.overlap=CWWKC1202E: Conflicting configuration of thread context {0} is found on ContextServiceDefinition {1}. The cleared context is {2}, the propagated context is {3}, and the unchanged context is {4}.
CWWKC1202.context.lists.overlap.explanation=A thread context type can be configured in any one of the cleared, propagated, or unchanged context type categories. The context type cannot be configured in multiple context type categories.
CWWKC1202.context.lists.overlap.useraction=Correct the configuration to specify the thread context type in at most one category.

CWWKC1203.duplicate.context=CWWKC1203E: The same thread context type, {0}, is provided by multiple thread context providers that are available to the application. The thread context providers are: {1}, {2}.
CWWKC1203.duplicate.context.explanation=There can only be one thread context provider for each context type.
CWWKC1203.duplicate.context.useraction=Update the application, libraries, or both so that no more than one thread context provider of the specified context type is accessible to the application.

CWWKC1204.not.serializable=CWWKC1204E: Cannot create a serializable contextual proxy that propagates thread context {0} which is not serializable.
CWWKC1204.not.serializable.explanation=Third-party thread context types are not compatible with serialization and cannot be configured to be propagated for serializable contextual proxies.
CWWKC1204.not.serializable.useraction=Update the application to request a non-serializable contextual proxy or ensure that no third-party context types are configured to be propagated.

CWWKC1205.qualifiers.require.cdi=CWWKC1205E: The {0} application artifact cannot \
 specify the {1} qualifiers on the {2} annotation or {3} deployment descriptor \
 element that has the {4} name because the {5} feature is not enabled.
CWWKC1205.qualifiers.require.cdi.explanation=The CDI feature is a prerequisite of \
 specifying qualifiers on a resource definition.
CWWKC1205.qualifiers.require.cdi.useraction=Enable the CDI feature.

CWWKC1206.qualifier.must.be.anno=CWWKC1206E: The {0} application artifact \
 specifies a {1} annotation or {2} deployment descriptor element that has the \
 {3} name and {4} qualifiers list. The qualifiers list includes a {5} value \
 that is not an annotation. All elements in the list must be annotation classes \
 that are annotated with @Qualifier and @Retention(RUNTIME). For example, {6}
CWWKC1206.qualifier.must.be.anno.explanation=Each value in the qualifiers \
 list must be an annotation class.
CWWKC1206.qualifier.must.be.anno.useraction=Ensure that all values in the \
 qualifiers list are annotation classes.

CWWKC1207.lacks.qualifier.anno=CWWKC1207E: The {0} application artifact \
 specifies a {1} annotation or {2} deployment descriptor element that has the \
 {3} name and {4} qualifiers list. The qualifiers list includes the \
 {5} annotation, which is not annotated with @jakarta.inject.Qualifier and \
 @Retention(RUNTIME). An example of a valid qualifier is: {6}
CWWKC1207.lacks.qualifier.anno.explanation=The Qualifier annotation indicates \
 that the annotation is a qualifier. The Retention annotation controls the \
 availability of annotations.
CWWKC1207.lacks.qualifier.anno.useraction=Add the @Qualifier and \
 @Retention(RUNTIME) annotations to the qualifier class.

CWWKC1217.no.virtual.threads=CWWKC1217I: The Concurrency specification requires \
 virtual=true to be ignored on the {0} application artifact's \
 {1} annotation or {2} deployment descriptor element with the {3} name \
 because Java {4} does not support virtual threads.
CWWKC1217.no.virtual.threads.explanation=Virtual threads are available only \
 in Java 21 and later.
CWWKC1217.no.virtual.threads.useraction=Update to Java 21 or later to enable the \
 use of virtual threads.


# Messages for @Asynchronous that are shared with other bundles:

CWWKC1400.unsupported.return.type=CWWKC1400E: {0} is not a valid return type for the {1} method of the {2} class. Valid return types for methods that are annotated with {3} are: {4}.
CWWKC1400.unsupported.return.type.explanation=The Jakarta concurrency specification limits the range of valid return types for methods that have this annotation.
CWWKC1400.unsupported.return.type.useraction=Update the method within the application to switch to one of the supported return types, or remove the annotation from the method.

CWWKC1401.class.anno.disallowed=CWWKC1401E: The {0} annotation is allowed at the method level. It cannot be used at the class level on the {1} class.
CWWKC1401.class.anno.disallowed.explanation=This annotation must not be specified at the class level.
CWWKC1401.class.anno.disallowed.useraction=Move the annotation to the individual methods of the class.

CWWKC1402.not.managed.executor=CWWKC1402E: The {0} annotation on the {1} method of the {2} class specifies the {3} JNDI name, which resolves to the {4} resource which is not a ManagedExecutorService or ManagedScheduledExecutorService. Interfaces implemented by the resource are: {5}.
CWWKC1402.not.managed.executor.explanation=The JNDI name must resolve to a resource that implements the ManagedExecutorService interface or ManagedScheduledExecutorService interface.
CWWKC1402.not.managed.executor.useraction=Correct the JNDI name to specify a resource that is accessible to the application component and implements the ManagedExecutorService interface or ManagedScheduledExecutorService interface.

CWWKC1403.unsupported.tx.type=CWWKC1403E: The {0} annotation specifies the {1} value, which is not permitted in combination with the {2} annotation that is on the {3} method of the {4} class. Permitted values are: {5}.
CWWKC1403.unsupported.tx.type.explanation=The use of two annotations together depends on whether the value of the first annotation that is specified is permitted with the second annotation.
CWWKC1403.unsupported.tx.type.useraction=Update the application to switch to one of the supported values or remove one of the annotations.
