CWWKC1200.resource.unavailable=CWWKC1200E: {0}, which is defined by application {1}, was not available in a timely manner.
CWWKC1200.resource.unavailable.explanation=Too much load on the system to process resource definition annotations and deployment descriptor entries before the application attempts to use them.
CWWKC1200.resource.unavailable.useraction=View the messages.log file to identify the occurrence of an error. Otherwise, reduce the load on the system.

CWWKC1201.contextsvc.inaccessible=CWWKC1201E: {0}, which is defined by application {1}, requires a ContextService {2} but the ContextService was inaccessible or not available in a timely manner.
CWWKC1201.contextsvc.inaccessible.explanation=The specified resource that implements the ContextService interface was inaccessible or not available because of any of the following reasons. 1.) A resource definition annotation or a resource definition in a deployment descriptor of the application specifies an incorrect JNDI name at which to find the resource that implements the ContextService interface. 2.) The resource that implements the ContextService interface is defined in a scope that is not accessible to the resource that requires the resource that implements the ContextService interface. 3.) The system is under too much load to register a resource that implements the ContextService interface in a timely manner.
CWWKC1201.contextsvc.inaccessible.useraction=Correct the application to refer to the JNDI name of the ContextService that is accessible. If the specified JNDI name is correct, reduce the load on the system.

CWWKC1202.context.lists.overlap=CWWKC1202E: Conflicting configuration of thread context {0} is found on ContextServiceDefinition {1}. The cleared context is {2}, the propagated context is {3}, and the unchanged context is {4}.
CWWKC1202.context.lists.overlap.explanation=A thread context type can be configured in any one of the cleared, propagated, or unchanged context type categories. The context type cannot be configured in multiple context type categories.
CWWKC1202.context.lists.overlap.useraction=Correct the configuration to specify the thread context type in at most one category.

CWWKC1203.duplicate.context=CWWKC1203E: The same thread context type, {0}, is provided by multiple thread context providers that are available to the application. The thread context providers are: {1}, {2}.
CWWKC1203.duplicate.context.explanation=There can only be one thread context provider for each context type.
CWWKC1203.duplicate.context.useraction=Update the application, libraries, or both so that no more than one thread context provider of the specified context type is accessible to the application.

CWWKC1204.not.serializable=CWWKC1204E: Cannot create a serializable contextual proxy that propagates thread context {0} which is not serializable.
CWWKC1204.not.serializable.explanation=Third-party thread context types are not compatible with serialization and cannot be configured to be propagated for serializable contextual proxies.
CWWKC1204.not.serializable.useraction=Update the application to request a non-serializable contextual proxy or ensure that no third-party context types are configured to be propagated.

CWWKC1205.qualifier.class.not.found=CWWKC1205E: The {0} qualifier annotation class, which is defined by a deployment descriptor, could not be loaded by the application classloader.
CWWKC1205.qualifier.class.not.found.explanation=Qualifier elements that are configured by the application.xml file or the web.xml file contain a class name that could not be loaded.
CWWKC1205.qualifier.class.not.found.useraction=Verify that the qualifier elements are configured with a fully qualified class name, and that the class is present within the application.

# Messages for @Asynchronous that are shared with other bundles:

CWWKC1400.unsupported.return.type=CWWKC1400E: {0} is not a valid return type for the {1} method of the {2} class. Valid return types for methods that are annotated with {3} are: {4}.
CWWKC1400.unsupported.return.type.explanation=The Jakarta concurrency specification limits the range of valid return types for methods that have this annotation.
CWWKC1400.unsupported.return.type.useraction=Update the method within the application to switch to one of the supported return types, or remove the annotation from the method.

CWWKC1401.class.anno.disallowed=CWWKC1401E: The {0} annotation is allowed at the method level. It cannot be used at the class level on the {1} class.
CWWKC1401.class.anno.disallowed.explanation=This annotation must not be specified at the class level.
CWWKC1401.class.anno.disallowed.useraction=Move the annotation to the individual methods of the class.

CWWKC1402.not.managed.executor=CWWKC1402E: The {0} annotation on the {1} method of the {2} class specifies the {3} JNDI name, which resolves to the {4} resource which is not a ManagedExecutorService or ManagedScheduledExecutorService. Interfaces implemented by the resource are: {5}.
CWWKC1402.not.managed.executor.explanation=The JNDI name must resolve to a resource that implements the ManagedExecutorService interface or ManagedScheduledExecutorService interface.
CWWKC1402.not.managed.executor.useraction=Correct the JNDI name to specify a resource that is accessible to the application component and implements the ManagedExecutorService interface or ManagedScheduledExecutorService interface.

CWWKC1403.unsupported.tx.type=CWWKC1403E: The {0} annotation specifies the {1} value, which is not permitted in combination with the {2} annotation that is on the {3} method of the {4} class. Permitted values are: {5}.
CWWKC1403.unsupported.tx.type.explanation=The use of two annotations together depends on whether the value of the first annotation that is specified is permitted with the second annotation.
CWWKC1403.unsupported.tx.type.useraction=Update the application to switch to one of the supported values or remove one of the annotations.
