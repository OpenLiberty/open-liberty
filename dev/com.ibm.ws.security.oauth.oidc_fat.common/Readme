I've added support for a few environment variables to the tooling.
We can set these to force the type of token, cert and validation 
endpoint.  With these set, we can control the setup for some of the 
jaxrs FAT projects.

PLEASE NOTE:  I am NOT checking of the value set for these environment
variables is any of the valid values that the FATs support, so, set
at your own risk - you put some odd value in and you'll probably get
odd behavior!!!!!!!!!!!!


To set the type of token the tests will use, set:
tokenType to either "jwt_token", or "access_token"

To set the type of cert used with JWT tokens, set:
certType to either "jwk_cert" or "x509_cert"
This value will only be used if the tokenType is jwt_token

To set the RS server validation type, set:
rsValidationType to "userinfo", or "introspect"
This value will only be used if the tokenType is access_token
