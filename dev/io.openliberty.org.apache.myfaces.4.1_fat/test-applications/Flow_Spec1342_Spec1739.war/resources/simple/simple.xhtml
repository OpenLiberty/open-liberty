    <!-- This is a simple JSF facelet; it utilizes EL to check if we're currently in a flow.
        If we are in a flow, the currentFlow value should be true.
        The flowScope value is checked to determine if that data is being passed around the flow correctly;
        the flowScope value can be modified via the text input on this page and the "Submit Value" button.
        The back button causes us to exit the flow.
