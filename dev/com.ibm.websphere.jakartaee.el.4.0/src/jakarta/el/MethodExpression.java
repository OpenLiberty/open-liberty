/**
 * An <code>Expression</code> that refers to a method on an object.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link ExpressionFactory#createMethodExpression} method can be used to parse an expression string and
 * return a concrete instance of <code>MethodExpression</code> that encapsulates the parsed expression. The
 * {@link FunctionMapper} is used at parse time, not evaluation time, so one is not needed to evaluate an expression
 * using this class. However, the {@link ELContext} is needed at evaluation time.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link #getMethodInfo} and {@link #invoke} methods will evaluate the expression each time they are called. The
 * {@link ELResolver} in the <code>ELContext</code> is used to resolve the top-level variables and to determine the
 * behavior of the <code>.</code> and <code>[]</code> operators. For any of the two methods, the
 * {@link ELResolver#getValue} method is used to resolve all properties up to but excluding the last one. This
 * provides the <code>base</code> object on which the method appears. If the <code>base</code> object is null, a
 * <code>PropertyNotFoundException</code> must be thrown. At the last resolution, the final <code>property</code> is
 * then coerced to a <code>String</code>, which provides the name of the method to be found. A method matching the name
 * and expected parameters provided at parse time is found and it is either queried or invoked (depending on the method
 * called on this <code>MethodExpression</code>).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * See the notes about comparison, serialization and immutability in the {@link Expression} javadocs.
