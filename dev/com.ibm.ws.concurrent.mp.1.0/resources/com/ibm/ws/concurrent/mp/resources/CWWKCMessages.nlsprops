#   Strings in this file which contain replacement variables are processed by the MessageFormat

#   which do NOT contain replacement variables are NOT processed by the MessageFormat class

# All messages must use the range CWWCK1150 to CWWCK1189 except those specifically identified as moved

CWWKC1150.duplicate.context=CWWKC1150E: The same thread context type, {0}, is provided by multiple thread context providers which are available to the application. Thread context providers are: {1}, {2}.
CWWKC1150.duplicate.context.explanation=The MicroProfile Context Propagation specification permits no more than one ThreadContextProvider for each context type.
CWWKC1150.duplicate.context.useraction=Update the available application, libraries, or both so that no more than one ThreadContextProvider of the specified type exists.

# do not translate: cleared, propagated
CWWKC1151.context.lists.overlap=CWWKC1151E: The ManagedExecutor configuration includes the following thread context types that are configured to be both cleared and propagated: {0}
CWWKC1151.context.lists.overlap.explanation=A thread context type can be configured in no more than one category when building or injecting a ManagedExecutor.
CWWKC1151.context.lists.overlap.useraction=Review and correct the categorization of thread context types in your ManagedExecutor builder or ManagedExecutorConfig annotation.

# do not translate: cleared, propagated, unchanged
CWWKC1152.context.lists.overlap=CWWKC1152E: The following thread context types are configured in more than one category of (cleared, propagated, unchanged): {0}.
CWWKC1152.context.lists.overlap.explanation=A thread context type can be configured in no more than one category when building or injecting a ThreadContext instance.
CWWKC1152.context.lists.overlap.useraction=Review and correct the categorization of thread context types in your ThreadContext builder or ThreadContextConfig annotation.

CWWKC1155.unknown.context=CWWKC1155E: Thread context types {0} are configured to be cleared or propagated, but no thread context providers for these types are available to the application. Available thread context types are: {1}.
CWWKC1155.unknown.context.explanation=For each configured thread context type that is not provided by the server, a thread context provider must be available on the application's thread context class loader. Thread context types provided by the server include: Application, CDI, Security, Transaction.
CWWKC1155.unknown.context.useraction=Update the application, libraries or both to include a thread context provider for each configured thread context type that is not provided by the server. Alternatively, update the application to only use the context types that are available.

CWWKC1156.not.supported=CWWKC1156E: The requested operation is not available as a static method on the managed executor implementation of CompletableFuture. Use the following operation instead: {0}.
CWWKC1156.not.supported.explanation=The managed executor implementation of CompletableFuture does not provide static method equivalents to the static methods of CompletableFuture. 
CWWKC1156.not.supported.useraction=Update the application to use the method that is recommended in the message in place of the requested operation.

CWWKC1157.cannot.propagate.tx=CWWKC1157E: Propagating transactions to contextual actions and tasks is not supported.
CWWKC1157.cannot.propagate.tx.explanation=A ManagedExecutor or ThreadContext that is configured to propagate transaction contexts can propagate empty transaction contexts only. Therefore, you cannot create contextual actions and tasks within a transaction.
CWWKC1157.cannot.propagate.tx.useraction=Create the contextual action or task outside of a transaction. Alternatively, configure the ManagedExecutor or ThreadContext to not propagate transaction contexts.
