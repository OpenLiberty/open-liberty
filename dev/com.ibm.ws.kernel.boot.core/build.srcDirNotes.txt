*Most* of the time, the classes in this src dir do not have access to OSGi
packages or resources.

Some packages will, because they are invoked as part of command line utilities
which place those classes on the delegated classpath.. 

Some classes in this directory are packaged in the cmdline bundle for 
use by utilities (com.ibm.ws.kernel.boot.cmdline)
