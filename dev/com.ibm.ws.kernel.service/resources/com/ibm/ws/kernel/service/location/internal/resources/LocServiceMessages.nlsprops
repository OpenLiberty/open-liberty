unreachableLocation=CWWKE0200E: The specified location is unreachable. It is not a child of a known or configured path; path={0}.
unreachableLocation.explanation=The platform uses symbolic paths to provide rudimentary protection from arbitrary access to the file system \
   when the location service is used to resolve specified paths. README.TXT contains information about how symbolic \
   paths are configured.
unreachableLocation.useraction=Check bootstrap.properties for configured paths, and ensure that the configured path \
   is a child of existing symbols or is associated with an explicitly defined symbol.

invalidResourceType=CWWKE0201E: Unable to create symbol; the specified location exists, and conflicts with required type: {0}={1}.
invalidResourceType.explanation=The path specified for a symbol exists, and is a different type of resource than the path specifies \
  (for example, the symbol describes a file, but the resource is a directory).
invalidResourceType.useraction=Ensure the path is specified correctly. Directory paths must end with a /. Ensure the path \
  refers to a resource that either does not exist, or exists and is of the required type.

missingTmpDir=CWWKE0202E: The specified temporary directory location does not exist and could not be created: {0}.
missingTmpDir.explanation=The directory specified as the java.io.tmpdir (either through a system property or a platform-specific \
  environment variable) does not exist and could not be created.
missingTmpDir.useraction=Ensure the specified directory exists and has read/write permissions.

relativeTmpDir=CWWKE0203I: The java.io.tempdir was specified with a relative path. The resolved path is {0}.
relativeTmpDir.explanation=The directory specified as the java.io.tmpdir (either through a system property or a platform-specific \
  environment variable) was relative, and is resolved relative to the launch directory.
relativeTmpDir.useraction=No action is required.

locationInitializationError=CWWKE0204E: Unable to initialize the platform location service; reason={0}.
locationInitializationError.explanation=CMSG0001
locationInitializationError.useraction=CMSG0002

frameworkShutdown=CWWKE0205W: The framework is shutting down because of a previous initialization error.
frameworkShutdown.explanation=The framework is shutting down because of a previous error during initialization.
frameworkShutdown.useraction=Resolve the error then restart the server.
