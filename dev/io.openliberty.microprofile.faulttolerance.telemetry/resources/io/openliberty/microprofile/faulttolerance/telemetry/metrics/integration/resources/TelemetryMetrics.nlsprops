ft.invocations.total.description=The number of times the method was called.

ft.retry.calls.total.description=The number of times the retry logic was run. This value is always equal to once per method call.

ft.retry.retries.total.description=The number of times the method was retried.

ft.timeout.calls.total.description=The number of times the timeout logic was run. This value is typically equal to once per method call. However, it might be zero if the circuit breaker prevents execution or more than once per method call if the method is retried.

ft.timeout.executionDuration.description=Histogram of execution times for the method.

ft.circuitbreaker.calls.total.description=The number of times the circuit breaker logic was run. This value is typically equal to once per method call, but might be more than once if the method is retried.

ft.circuitbreaker.state.total.description=Amount of time the circuit breaker spent in each state.

ft.circuitbreaker.opened.total.description=Number of times the circuit breaker moved from closed state to open state.

ft.bulkhead.calls.total.description=The number of times the bulkhead logic was run. This value is typically equal to once per method call. However, it might be zero if the circuit breaker prevents execution or more than once per method call if the method is retried.

ft.bulkhead.executionsRunning.description=Number of currently running executions.

ft.bulkhead.executionsWaiting.description=Number of executions that are currently waiting in the queue.

ft.bulkhead.runningDuration.description=Histogram of the time that method executions spent running.

ft.bulkhead.waitingDuration.description=Histogram of the time that method executions spent waiting in the queue.
