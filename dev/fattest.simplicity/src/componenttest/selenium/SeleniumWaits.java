 * Utility methods for waiting for things in Selenium tests
 * <p>
 * After taking actions, Selenium tests often need to wait a short period of time for things to happen in the browser. Unfortunately the syntax for doing such a wait is a little
 * cumbersome. Selenium does have an option to implicitly wait on every operation, but this can't be combined with explicit waiting elsewhere in the test.
