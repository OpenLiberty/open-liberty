/**
 * This is a interface for CDI Runtime extensions. Liberty features that wish to extend CDI will need to
 * register a service under this interface.
 * <p>
 * To use this class you must implement at least one of the three methods. If you implement {@link #getBeanClasses()} all classes returned by that
 * method will be registered with CDI and may be used normally by application code. If you implement {@link #getBeanDefiningAnnotationClasses()} 
 * all annotations returned by that method will become bean defining annotations as per the CDI specifications. If you implement {@link #getExtensions()} then
 * all classes returned by that method will be treated as CDI extensions any observer methods for container lifecycle events will be called
 * when creating the CDI container for each application. All three methods can be implemented in the same class.
 * <p>
 * Classes returned from {@code getExtensions()} must implement {@link javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Extension}. They do <b>not</b> and should not be listed in a
 * {@code META-INF/services file}. It is best practice to not put CDIExtensionMetaData and {@code javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Extension} on the same class
 * as that would result in CDI and OSGI independently instantiating the class. Even though it is unlikely for the two instances to conflict,
 * it is best to keep the OSGI service and CDI extension separate.
 * <p>
 * The class that implements this interface should be registered as an OSGi service, for example by annotating it with
 * {@code @Component(service = CDIExtensionMetadata.class, configurationPolicy=IGNORE)}.
 * <p>
 * Here is a worked example of a complete CDIExtensionMetadata implementation.
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Component(service = CDIExtensionMetaData.class, configurationPolicy = IGNORE)
 * public class SPIMetaData implements CDIExtensionMetaData {
 *
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getBeanClasses() {
 *         Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; beans = new HashSet&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt;();
 *         //This will register a producer class and expose it's produced beans to applications
 *         beans.add(ClassSPIRegisteredProducer.class);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>

/*
