The plan for Key/Trust stores for FAT testing is:

1) All common key/trust stores will reside in this directory and be copied during the build to 
	each and every security server that needs them.
2) Project specific key/trust stores will reside in the "publish/shared/securityKeys" directory of that project.
	All of those files should be copied into ever server that needs them.
3) Finally, any key/trust stores that are specific to an individual server can reside in that
	servers publish/servers/<servername>/securityKeys directory.
