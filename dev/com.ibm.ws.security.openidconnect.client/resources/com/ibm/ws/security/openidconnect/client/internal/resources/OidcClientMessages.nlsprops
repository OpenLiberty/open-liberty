# do not translate hostname, wasReqURLRedirectDomainNames, and webAppSecurity
OIDC_CLIENT_BAD_REQUEST_MALFORMED_URL_IN_COOKIE=CWWKS1532E: A request to [{0}] is not valid. A required cookie with a name that begins with WASReqURLOidc has an incorrect value. The host name [{1}] that is used in the cookie does not match the name that is registered at the provider. A response code of 500 is returned.
OIDC_CLIENT_BAD_REQUEST_MALFORMED_URL_IN_COOKIE.explanation=A request was received that includes a malformed cookie.
OIDC_CLIENT_BAD_REQUEST_MALFORMED_URL_IN_COOKIE.useraction=Verify the OpenID Connect provider and client configurations. The malformed cookie can be caused by cookie modification at the user agent with a host name that differs from the host name of the redirect that is registered with the provider. If the host name is expected, then add it to the wasReqURLRedirectDomainNames attribute of the webAppSecurity element in server.xml.
