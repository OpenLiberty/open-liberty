/**
 * Allow the user to select zero or more items from a set of
 * available options. This is presented as a listbox which allows
 * multiple rows in the list to be selected simultaneously.
 * <p>
 * The set of available options is defined by adding child
 * f:selectItem or f:selectItems components to this component.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The list is rendered as an HTML select element. The "multiple"
 * attribute is set on the element and the size attribute is set to
 * the provided value, defaulting to the number of items in the list
 * if no value is provided. If the size is set to 1, then a
 * "drop-down" list (aka "combo-box") is presented, though if this is
 * the intention then a selectManyMenu should be used instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The value attribute must be a value-binding expression to a
 * property of type List, Object array or primitive array. That
 * "collection" is expected to contain objects of the same type as
 * SelectItem.getValue() returns for the child SelectItem objects.
 * On rendering, any child whose value is in the list will be
 * selected initially. During the update phase, the property is set
 * to contain a "collection" of values for those child SelectItem
 * objects that are currently selected.
 * </p>
