binaryLog=Binary Log
binaryLog.desc=Binary logging options.  The binary log can be viewed using the logViewer command.
binaryLog.dataDirectory=Repository location
binaryLog.dataDirectory.desc=Specifies the location on the local file system to store binary log files.  The default location is inherited from the logDirectory attribute of the logging element.
binaryLog.purgeMaxSize=Maximum repository size
binaryLog.purgeMaxSize.desc=Specifies the maximum size for the binary log repository in megabytes.  When the value for purgeMaxSize is specified with a value of more than 0, cleanup based on repository size is enabled, otherwise it is disabled; a value of 0 means no limit.
binaryLog.purgeMinTime=Minimum retention time
binaryLog.purgeMinTime.desc=Specifies the duration, in hours, after which a server can remove a log record.  When the value for purgeMinTime is specified with a value of more than 0, cleanup based on log record age is enabled, otherwise it is disabled; a value of 0 means no limit.
binaryLog.fileSwitchTime=Hour of the day to switch file
binaryLog.fileSwitchTime.desc=Makes the server close the active log file and start a new one at the specified hour of the day.  When the value for fileSwitchTime is specified, file switching is enabled, otherwise it is disabled.
binaryLog.bufferingEnabled=Enable output buffering
binaryLog.bufferingEnabled.desc=Specifies whether to allow a small delay in saving records to the disk for improved performance.  When bufferingEnabled is set to true, records will be briefly held in memory before being written to disk.
binaryLog.outOfSpaceAction=Action if data can't be stored
binaryLog.outOfSpaceAction.desc=Specifies the action to perform when the file system where records are kept runs out of free space.  When outOfSpaceAction is set to "StopLogging" the server will stop logging when records are not able to be written to disk.  When this attribute is set to "PurgeOld" the server will attempt to delete the oldest records from the binary log repository to make space for new records.  When this attribute is set to "StopServer" the binary log will stop the server when records cannot be written.


binaryTrace=Binary Trace
binaryTrace.desc=Binary trace options.  The binary trace can be viewed using the logViewer command.
binaryTrace.dataDirectory=Repository location
binaryTrace.dataDirectory.desc=Specifies the location on the local file system to store binary trace files.  The default location is inherited from the logDirectory attribute of the logging element.
#binaryTrace.memoryBufferSize=Size of the memory ring buffer
#binaryTrace.memoryBufferSize.desc=Specifies the maximum size of in memory buffer in megabytes (MB).
binaryTrace.purgeMaxSize=Maximum repository size
binaryTrace.purgeMaxSize.desc=Specifies the maximum size for the binary trace repository in megabytes.  When the value for purgeMaxSize is specified with a value of more than 0, cleanup based on repository size is enabled, otherwise it is disabled; a value of 0 means no limit.
binaryTrace.purgeMinTime=Minimum retention time
binaryTrace.purgeMinTime.desc=Specifies the duration, in hours, after which a server can remove a trace record.  When the value for purgeMinTime is specified with a value of more than 0, cleanup based on trace record age is enabled, otherwise it is disabled; a value of 0 means no limit.
binaryTrace.fileSwitchTime=Hour of the day to switch file
binaryTrace.fileSwitchTime.desc=Makes the server close the active trace file and start a new one at the specified hour of the day.  When the value for fileSwitchTime is specified, file switching is enabled, otherwise it is disabled.
binaryTrace.bufferingEnabled=Enable output buffering
binaryTrace.bufferingEnabled.desc=Specifies whether to allow a small delay in saving records to the disk for improved performance.  When bufferingEnabled is set to true, records will be briefly held in memory before being written to disk.
binaryTrace.outOfSpaceAction=Action if data can't be stored
binaryTrace.outOfSpaceAction.desc=Specifies the action to perform when the file system where records are kept runs out of free space.  When outOfSpaceAction is set to "StopLogging" the server will stop tracing when records are not able to be written to disk.  When this attribute is set to "PurgeOld" the server will attempt to delete the oldest records from the binary trace repository to make space for new records.  When this attribute is set to "StopServer" binary trace will stop the server when records cannot be written.

textLog=Text Log
textLog.desc=Text log options.  The text log files can be viewed using any text editor.
textLog.dataDirectory=Repository location
textLog.dataDirectory.desc=Specifies the location on the local file system to store text log files.  The default location is inherited from the logDirectory attribute of the logging element.
textLog.outputFormat=Format to use for the text log files
textLog.outputFormat.desc=Text output format to use for the text log files.  
textLog.includeTrace=Include trace records in the text log files
textLog.includeTrace.desc=Specifies whether or not to include trace records in the text log files.
textLog.purgeMaxSize=Maximum repository size
textLog.purgeMaxSize.desc=Specifies the maximum total size for the text log files in megabytes.  When the value for purgeMaxSize is specified with a value of more than 0, cleanup based on total size for text log files is enabled, otherwise it is disabled; a value of 0 means no limit.
textLog.purgeMinTime=Minimum retention time
textLog.purgeMinTime.desc=Specifies the duration, in hours, after which a server can remove a text log record.  When the value for purgeMinTime is specified with a value of more than 0, cleanup based on log/trace record age is enabled, otherwise it is disabled; a value of 0 means no limit.
textLog.fileSwitchTime=Hour of the day to switch file
textLog.fileSwitchTime.desc=Makes the server close the active text log file and start a new one at the specified hour of the day.  When the value for fileSwitchTime is specified, file switching is enabled, otherwise it is disabled.
textLog.bufferingEnabled=Enable output buffering
textLog.bufferingEnabled.desc=Specifies whether to allow a small delay in saving records to the disk for improved performance.  When bufferingEnabled is set to true, records will be briefly held in memory before being written to disk.
textLog.outOfSpaceAction=Action if data can't be stored
textLog.outOfSpaceAction.desc=Specifies the action to perform when the file system where text log files are kept runs out of free space.  When outOfSpaceAction is set to "StopLogging" the server will stop logging/tracing when records are not able to be written to disk.  When this attribute is set to "PurgeOld" the server will attempt to delete the oldest records from the text log repository to make space for new records.  When this attribute is set to "StopServer" the text log will stop the server when records cannot be written.
