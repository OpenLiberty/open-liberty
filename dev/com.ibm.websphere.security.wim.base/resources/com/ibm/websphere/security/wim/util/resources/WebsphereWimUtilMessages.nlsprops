DUPLICATE_PROPERTY_EXTENDED=CWIML1996W: The extended property ''{0}'' is ignored because it was already defined for the ''{1}'' entity.
DUPLICATE_PROPERTY_EXTENDED.explanation=The extended property is already defined, and the duplicate definition is ignored, because two properties cannot have the same name.
DUPLICATE_PROPERTY_EXTENDED.useraction=Check for multiple definitions for the extended property in the server configuration. Delete or rename duplicates.

DUPLICATE_PROPERTY_ENTITY=CWIML1997W: The extended property ''{0}'' is ignored because it cannot override the property of the same name for the ''{1}'' entity.
DUPLICATE_PROPERTY_ENTITY.explanation=Because the property is already defined in the entity's schema, it is ignored since it cannot be redefined as an extended property.
DUPLICATE_PROPERTY_ENTITY.useraction=Check the entity's schema to determine if the property can be used. Either rename or delete the conflicting extended property from the server configuration.
