jms.common.temporaryTopicNamePrefix.desc=The prefix of up to twelve characters used for the temporary topics created by applications that use this topic connection factory.
jms.common.remoteServerAddress=Remote server address
jms.common.remoteServerAddress.desc=The remote server address that has triplets separated by a comma, with the syntax hostName:portNumber:chainName, used to connect to a bootstrap server. For example, Merlin:7276:BootstrapBasicMessaging. If hostName is not specified, the default is localhost. If portNumber is not specified, the default is 7276. If chainName is not specified, the default is BootstrapBasicMessaging. Refer to the information center for more information.
jms.common.targetTransportChain=Transport chain
jms.common.targetTransportChain.desc=Transport chains specify the communication protocols that can be used to communicate with the service integration bus in WebSphere Application Server traditional.
jms.common.shareDurableSubscription=Share durable subscription
jms.common.shareDurableSubscription.desc=Controls whether or not durable subscription can be shared across connections.
jms.common.durableSubscriptionHome= Durable subscription home
jms.common.durableSubscriptionHome.desc=Durable subscription home defines ME name to which connection needs to be established.

properties.wasJms.Topic.desc=The name of the topic that this JMS topic is assigned to, in the topic space defined by the Topic space property.
topic.TopicSpace=Topic space
topic.TopicSpace.desc=A topic space is a location for publish/subscribe messaging.

properties.wasJms.Queue.desc=The name of the queue that this JMS queue is assigned to.
queue.QueueName=Queue name
queue.QueueName.desc=The name of the associated Queue
queue.DeliveryMode=Delivery mode
queue.DeliveryMode.desc=The delivery mode for messages sent to this destination. This controls the persistence of messages on this destination.

jms.as.properties=Embedded Messaging
