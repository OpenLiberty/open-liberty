NOT_REGISTERED_WITH_REQUIRED_ANGEL.useraction=Make sure that the angel process is started and that the server is able to connect to and register with it. Alternatively, change the configuration to allow the server to start without registering with an angel process.

#{0} is the name of the angel process.  1-54 characters.
#{1} is an integer reason code.
ANGEL_NOT_AVAILABLE_NAME=CWWKB0117W: The {0} angel process is not available. No authorized services will be loaded. The reason code is {1}.

ANGEL_NOT_AVAILABLE_NAME.useraction=If the server requires authorized services, start an angel process on this system so that this server can load its authorized code and make the authorized services available. The message text includes an internal reason code to be used by product support. If the problem persists, see the problem determination information on the following WebSphere Application Server Support web page: http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/was/support. If no authorized services are required by this server, then no action is required. To prevent this message from appearing, remove the com.ibm.ws.zos.core.angelName property from the bootstrap.properties file.

#{0} is the name of the angel process. 1-54 characters.
SERVER_NOT_AUTHORIZED_TO_CONNECT_TO_ANGEL_NAME=CWWKB0118W: This server is not authorized to connect to the {0} angel process. No authorized services will be loaded.
SERVER_NOT_AUTHORIZED_TO_CONNECT_TO_ANGEL_NAME.explanation=The user ID that started this server does not have access to the System Authorization Facility (SAF) profile for the angel process named in the message. Read access to that profile is required to connect to this angel process.
SERVER_NOT_AUTHORIZED_TO_CONNECT_TO_ANGEL_NAME.useraction=If the server requires authorized services, consult the documentation on how to set up a named angel. If no authorized services are required by this server, then no action is required.

ANGEL_NAME_UNSUPPORTED_CHARACTER.useraction=This server will not connect to an angel process. To connect to an angel process, specify a value using the supported character set for the com.ibm.ws.zos.core.angelName property, and restart the server.

#{0} is the server's UMASK value.
SERVER_CURRENT_UMASK=CWWKB0121I: The server process UMASK value is set to {0}.
SERVER_CURRENT_UMASK.explanation=The server process UMASK value. By default the UMASK value is inherited from the process that started the liberty server, but is then further modified to disallow any read, write, or execute access to OTHER users. Setting the WLP_SKIP_UMASK environment variable to true prevents the server from modifying the UMASK in this way. When a Liberty server is started using a z/OS procedure, you can customize the UMASK used by the server process by defining the WLP_SKIP_UMASK and the _BPX_BATCH_UMASK environment variables. WLP_SKIP_UMASK can be specified either in the server.env file or, if the server is started using a z/OS procedure, it can be specified using the STDENDV DD entry. In contrast, _BPX_BATCH_UMASK cannot be specified in the server.env file. It must only be specified using the STDENV DD entry in the z/OS procedure.
SERVER_CURRENT_UMASK.useraction=No action is required.

#{0} is the name of the angel process. 1-54 characters.
SERVER_CONNECTED_TO_ANGEL=CWWKB0122I: This server is connected to the {0} angel process.

ANGEL_WAIT_TIME_OUT_OF_RANGE_OR_INVLID.explanation=The server has the wrong configuration for angel's startup waiting time. The allowable range is from 0 to 300 seconds.
ANGEL_WAIT_TIME_OUT_OF_RANGE_OR_INVLID.useraction=This server will use the default waiting time 0(s) to connect to the required Angel. To configure the valid startup waiting time, specify an integer value between 0 and 300 in the com.ibm.ws.zos.core.angelWaitTimeSeconds property, and restart the server.

#{0} is the configured time that liberty server will wait the required angel to start, {1} is the name of the required angel process.
REQUIRED_ANGEL_WAITTIME_NAME_PROMPT=CWWKB0124I: Angel {1} is required, server was configured to wait up to {0} seconds to connect to the targeted Angel.
REQUIRED_ANGEL_WAITTIME_NAME_PROMPT.explanation=This server requires the Angel to start, also has specified a maximum startup wait time until shutdown if it fails to register with the required Angel.
REQUIRED_ANGEL_WAITTIME_NAME_PROMPT.useraction=No action is required.

REGION_REQUESTED.explanation=This message displays various values from the Local Data Area (LDA) control block, which can be useful for debugging an out-of-storage condition. The region size is the storage region that is allocated to the address space, indicated in kilobytes. The below and above the line limits are given in megabytes. The "LINE" is the boundary between 24-bit and 31-bit storage addresses.

REGION_REQUESTED.useraction=No action is required.

MEMORY_LIMIT_INFORMATION=CWWKB0126I: MEMLIMIT={0}. MEMLIMIT CONFIGURATION SOURCE={1}.
MEMORY_LIMIT_INFORMATION.explanation=Displays the configured MEMLIMIT for the address space, and the MEMLIMIT configuration source. The MEMLIMIT CONFIGURATION SOURCE is one of the following values. "SMF" either set by SMF in SMFPRMxx or set to 0 by default. "JCL" set by the JCL. "REG0" Unlimited size based on the REGION=0 specification. "USI" is configured by the IEFSMFIE field and set by using the IEFUSI exit. "OMVS" set by the UNIX OMVS segment. "SETR" set by the UNIX setrlimit. "SPW" set by UNIX spawn. "SETO" set by the UNIX SETOMVS command. "AUTH" set by the authorized application modification."URG" set in IEFSMFIE by the IEFUSI exit. "UNKNOWN" set by unknown source. "BAD" Error setting MEMLIMIT.
MEMORY_LIMIT_INFORMATION.useraction=No action is required.

OLD_ANGEL_VERSION=CWWKB0127W: The current angel version is earlier than the version that the server expects. Update the angel version to the latest available version.
OLD_ANGEL_VERSION.explanation=The server has an expected value for the version of the angel process. The current version is earlier than the expected version. If a Liberty server instance connects to an angel that is running at an earlier service level, some features of the server might not be available.
OLD_ANGEL_VERSION.useraction=To ensure that all features of the server are available to the angel process, update the angel to the latest version.
