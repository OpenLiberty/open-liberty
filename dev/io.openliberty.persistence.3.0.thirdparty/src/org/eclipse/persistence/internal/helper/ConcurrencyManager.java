     * deferred locks - so it has acquire the cache key, it is going about its business (e.g. committing a transaction
     * or perhaps doing object building. Normally, but not always, in object building threads do have a lock manager,
     * but sometimes not when they agressive acquire lock policy. )

     * @param finalDeferredLockCausingTrouble
     *            this is a lock that was deferred either by current thread or by a thread that is also itself waiting
     *            around . This lock is what is causing us ultimately to return FALSE, because the lock is still ACUIRED
     *            so not yet free. And the thread that owns it is also still not finished yet.
     *
     * @param activeThreadOnDeferredLock
     *            this is the thread that was spotted as owning/being actively owning the the deferred lock. So we can
     *            consider this thread as being the ultimate cause of why the current thread and perhaps a hole chaing
     *            of related threads are not evolving. But certainly the current thread.
     * @param hasDeferredLockManager
     *            Some threads have deferred lock managers some not. Not clear when they do. But threads doing object
     *            building typically end up creating a deferred lock manager when they find themselves unable to acquire
     *            an object and need to defer on the cache key.
     * @param justification
     *            this is what we want to populate it will allow us to build a trace to explain why the thread on the
     *            wait for deferred lock is going nowhere. This trace will be quite important to help us interpret the
     *            massive dumps since it is quite typical to find threads in this state.
