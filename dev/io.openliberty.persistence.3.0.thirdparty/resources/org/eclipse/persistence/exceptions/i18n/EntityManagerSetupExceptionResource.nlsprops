28001=A ValidationException was thrown while trying to create session: [{0}] . The most likely causes of this issue are that your [{1}] file is not available on the classpath or it does not contain a session called: [{0}].

28002=EclipseLink is attempting to load a ServerSession named [{0}] from [{1}], and not getting a ServerSession.

28003=EclipseLink has loaded Session [{0}] from [{1}] and it either does not have a server platform specified or specifies a server platform that does not use and external transaction controller.  Specify an appropriate server platform if you plan to use JTA.

28004=Error in setup of EntityManager factory: JavaSECMPInitializer.initializeFromMain returned false.

28005=An Exception was thrown in setup of EntityManager factory.

28006=ClassNotFound: [{0}] specified in [{1}] property.

28007=Failed to instantiate ServerPlatform of type [{0}] specified in [{1}] property.

28008=Class: {0} was not found while processing annotations.

28009=Attempted to redeploy a session named {0} without closing it.

28010=PersistenceUnitInfo {0} has transactionType JTA, but does not have a jtaDataSource defined.

28011=The session, [{0}], built for a persistence unit was not available at the time it was deployed.  This means that somehow the session was removed from the container in the middle of the deployment process.

28012=Value [{0}] is of incorrect type for property [{2}], value type should be [{1}].

28013=Unable to deploy PersistenceUnit [{0}] in invalid state [{1}].

28014=Exception was thrown while processing property [{0}] with value [{1}].

28015=Failed to instantiate SessionLog of type [{0}] specified in [{1}] property.

28016=The persistence unit with name [{0}] does not exist.

28017=Unable to predeploy PersistenceUnit [{0}] in invalid state [{1}].

28018=Predeployment of PersistenceUnit [{0}] failed.

28019=Deployment of PersistenceUnit [{0}] failed. Close all factories for this PersistenceUnit.

28020=The session with name [{0}] loaded from [{1}] is [{2}], it however must be ServerSession.

28021=PersistenceUnit [{0}] attempts to load a session from [{1}] without providing a session name.  A session name should be provided by defining the eclipselink.session-name property.

28022=Value [true] for the property [eclipselink.weaving] is incorrect when global instrumentation is null, value should either be null, false, or static.

28023=The method invocation of the method [{0}] on the object [{1}], of class [{2}], triggered an exception.

28024=Cannot reflectively access the method [{0}] for object [{1}], of class [{2}].

28025=The persistence unit with name [{0}] has returned a [null] temporary classLoader - weaving has been disabled for this session.  You may use static weaving is an optional workaround.

28026=org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.osgi.PersistenceProvider does not support container deployment (createContainerEntityManagerFactory).  Use org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider instead.

28027=An attempt has been made to use PersistenceUnit [{0}], but no bundle is available that defines that persistence unit.

28028=Failed to instantiate class instance [{0}] for persistence unit property [{1}], ensure constructor is defined correctly.

28029=PersistenceUnit [{0}] tries both to use sessions.xml (specifies eclipselink.sessions-xml property) and to be a composite (specifies eclipselink.composite-unit property with value true). These modes are incompatible.

28030=PersistenceUnit [{0}] specifies eclipselink.composite-unit.member property with value true. That means it cannot be used standalone, but only as a composite member.

28031=Missing the required property [{0}].

28032=Failed to create temporary classloader with doPrivileged.
