/**
 * Common annotations access type.
 *
 * Access to annotations depends on several key parameters:
 * 
 * <ul><li>Application name</li>
 *     <li>Module name</li>
 *     <li>Module category name</li>
 *     <li>Root Container</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The application name may be left unspecified, in which case, the
 * annotations data is not cached, and the module name and the module
 * category name are unused.
 * 
 * If the application name is specified, a module name and a module
 * category name must be specified.  The annotations data is cached
 * in a two tier storage structure which has a single folder for each
 * unique application name and a single folder for each unique combination
 * of module name and module category name.
 * 
 * Annotations data for a module is assembled from a collection of
 * containers, each of which has a scan policy -- SEED, PARTIAL, EXCLUDED --
 * plus a class loader (which has the scan policy EXTERNAL.
 * 
 * The results for each container is written to a cache location keyed
 * to the full path of the container scoped to the application.  That
 * enables sharing of container results between modules.  (Container
 * results obtained with an unspecified application name are not cached.)
 *
 * The access layer is responsible for assigning the correct path to
 * containers, including adjustments for processing WEB-INF/classes
 * within a web module, which has special processing.
 * 
 * The processing of WEB-INF/classes uses a mapped container class source,
 * with the enclosing module container as the container of the class source,
 * with the class source specified with entry prefix of "WEB-INF/classes", and
 * with the class source path assigned as the full path to the WEB-INF/classes
 * container.
