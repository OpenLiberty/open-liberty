#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

messagingEngine=Messaging Engine
messagingEngine.desc=A messaging engine is a component, running inside a server, that manages messaging resources. Applications are connected to a messaging engine when they send and receive messages.

fileStore=File Store
fileStore.desc=Messaging file store.
path=File store path
path.desc=Path to the file store.
logFileSize=Log size
logFileSize.desc=Size in megabytes of the log file. The log file size cannot exceed half the size of the file store size. For a file store size set to 400 MB, the log file size cannot exceed 200 MB. The maximum recommended log file size is 25% of the file store size. For a file store size set to 400 MB, the maximum recommended setting for log file size would be 100 MB.
fileStoreSize=File store size
fileStoreSize.desc=The combined size in megabytes for both permanent and temporary store. The file store size is equally divided between permanent  and temporary store. For example, if you specify 400 MB as file store size then 200 MB is used for permanent store and 200 MB is used for temporary store.

messagingSecurity=Messaging Security
messagingSecurity.desc=Security for the wasJmsServer-1.0 feature.

queue=Queue
queue.desc=A queue destination represents a message queue and is used for point-to-point messaging.
queueId=Queue name
queueId.desc=The name of the queue.

topicSpace=Topic Space
topicSpace.desc=A topic space destination represents a set of "publish and subscribe" topics and is used for publish/subscribe messaging.
topicId=Topic space name
topicId.desc=The name of the topic space.

alias=Alias
alias.desc=An alias destination maps an alternative name for a bus destination. You can use an alias destination for point-to-point messaging or publish/subscribe messaging.
aliasId=Alias name
aliasId.desc=The name of the alias queue or alias topic space.


forceReliability=Force reliability
forceReliability.desc=The reliability assigned to a message produced to this destination when an explicit reliability has not been set by the producer.
exceptionDestination=Exception destination name
exceptionDestination.desc=The destination to which a message is forwarded by the system when it cannot be delivered to this destination.
failedDeliveryPolicy=Failed delivery policy
failedDeliveryPolicy.desc=Lists the actions that the messaging engine must take when the maxredeliverycount is reached for a message.
redeliveryInterval=Redelivery interval
redeliveryInterval.desc=When no exception destination is configured, the time interval to apply between retry attempts, after the maximum failed deliveries limit is reached, for this destination.
maxRedeliveryCount=Maximum redelivery count
maxRedeliveryCount.desc=The maximum number of failed attempts to process a message. After this number of failed attempts, if an exception destination is configured, the message is forwarded from the intended destination to its exception destination. If an exception destination is not configured, a time interval between retry attempts is applied.
sendAllowed=Send allowed
sendAllowed.desc=Producers can send messages to this destination.
receiveAllowed=Receive allowed
receiveAllowed.desc=Clear this option (setting it to false) to prevent consumers from being able to receive messages from this destination.
maintainStrictOrder=Maintain strict message order
maintainStrictOrder.desc=Maintains the order in which a producer sends messages to the destination.
maxMessageDepth=Maximum message depth
maxMessageDepth.desc=The maximum number of messages that the messaging engine can place on its message points.
targetDestination=Target destination
targetDestination.desc=The target destination parameter identifies a destination that might be within the same Bus as the alias destination. By default, if no property is set, it points to Default.Queue.
