/**
 * A gRPC client for connecting to the Jaeger trace retrieval API - https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.23/apis/#trace-retrieval-apis
 * <p>
 * Generated from https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-idl/tree/main/proto/api_v2
 * <p>
 * Generating the client using the Makefile was straightforward (it starts a docker container which has all the dependencies), but I needed to manually remove references to
 * "GoGoProtos" from the generated code.
