/**

 * this object is used to see in an Address is contained in a given list
 * of addresses. The tree is structured such that each substring between
 * periods (".") in a URL is a node of the tree. Subsequent nodes are valid
 * address paths from preceding nodes. A wildcard is allowed to be the first
 * substring in an address that is placed in the tree. For this reason, the
 * tree is built "backwards". The last substring of the URL is the first node
 * in an address path through the tree. This list is "slow" because the nodes
 * are based on the substrings and not the hashcodes of the substrings,
 * therefore
 * tree traversal is slower due to string compares.
