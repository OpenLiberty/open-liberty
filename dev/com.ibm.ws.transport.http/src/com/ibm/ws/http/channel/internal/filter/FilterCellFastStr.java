/**
 * A Cell (or node) of an address tree. The tree defines a set of
 * string URL addresses. Each cell represents a valid string for one of the
 * positions
 * in the address. A cell string is defined as the characters between two
 * periods
 * in an address. Each cell contains a hash table of valid cells (strings)
 * which may come after, in the next position of the address, this cell.
 * Each cell can also represent a wildcard. A wildcard cell contains
 * the next cells which may come after, in the next position of the
 * address, a wildcard in this position. The tree is build backwards, that is
 * the rightmost strings in an address are at the root of the address tree.
 * Wildcards may only appear once in an address that is represented in this
 * tree, and no characters may precede the wildcard. Finally, this object
 * is described as fast because it uses hashcodes (and lengths) of strings as
 * keys into the HashMap for the next cells.
 * This allows for faster, but less complete, comparisons.
