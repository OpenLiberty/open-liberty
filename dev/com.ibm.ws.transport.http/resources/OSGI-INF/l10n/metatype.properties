dispatcher.trustedHeaderOrigin=Trusted private header origin
dispatcher.trustedHeaderOrigin.desc=Private headers are used by the web server plug-in to provide information about the original \
 request. These headers take precedence over the http Host header, and are used to select a virtual host to service a request. The \
 default value is '*', which will trust incoming private headers from any source. Specify 'none' to disable private headers and rely \
 only on the http Host header, or specify a list of IP addresses to restrict private header processing to specific trusted sources.

dispatcher.trustedSensitiveHeaderOrigin=Trusted sensitive private header origin
dispatcher.trustedSensitiveHeaderOrigin.desc=Private headers are used by the web server plug-in to provide information about the original \
request. A subset of these headers are considered sensitive. By default, the value for this property is 'none'. Incoming, sensitive private \
headers are not trusted from any source. Specify a comma-separated list of IP addresses, such as {1.1.2.2, F:FF:FFF:FFFF:1:11:111:1111} to allow \
sensitive private header processing for specific trusted sources, or specify '*' to trust incoming sensitive private headers from any source.

#HttpProxyRedirect
http.proxyredirect=HTTP Proxy Redirect
http.proxyredirect.desc=Configures port redirection. HTTP Proxy Redirect is used when redirecting HTTP requests from a non-secure port (for example, 80) to an SSL-enabled secured port (for example, 443).

http.proxyredirect.enabled=Enabled
http.proxyredirect.enabled.desc=This attribute determines whether or not the server should redirect ports that are specified in this configuration element. The default is true.

http.proxyredirect.host=Host
http.proxyredirect.host.desc=The host name used for this proxy redirect. The server redirects HTTP requests only if the incoming request specifies a host name that matches this value. The default is * (all hosts).

http.proxyredirect.httpPort=HTTP port

http.autoDecompression.desc=Specifies whether the HTTP Channel automatically decompresses incoming request body data.

http.decompressionRatioLimit=Decompression ratio limit
http.decompressionRatioLimit.desc=Specifies the maximum ratio of decompressed to compressed request body payload. The HTTP channel reads the request body and verifies the ratio as the body decompresses. The channel stops decompression of the request body if the decompression ratio remains above the configured value and the decompressionTolerance is reached.

http.decompressionTolerance=Decompression tolerance
http.decompressionTolerance.desc=Specifies the maximum number of times the HTTP channel tolerates a decompression ratio above the configured ratio, depicted by the decompressionRatioLimit httpOption attribute. If this number reaches, and the next decompression cycle still contains a decompression ratio above the ratio limit, then the HTTP channel stops decompressing the request body.

http.compression.types=List of content types for response compression
http.compression.types.desc=To include a content type in addition to the default values, affix the add (+) character as a prefix to that content type. To exclude a content type from compression, affix the remove (-) character as a prefix to that content type. Note: The wildcard (*) character is supported only as a content subtype, such as text/*.

http.compression.serverPreferredAlgorithm=Server-preferred algorithm for compression
http.compression.serverPreferredAlgorithm.desc=The configured compression algorithm is used to compress the body of responses when it is specified with a non-zero quality value in the request's Accept-Encoding header. The valid compression algorithms include: deflate, gzip, x-gzip, zlib, and identity.

http.samesite.lax=List of samesite lax cookies
http.samesite.lax.desc=List of cookie names or patterns for which the SameSite attribute is set to a value of Lax, if not already defined.
