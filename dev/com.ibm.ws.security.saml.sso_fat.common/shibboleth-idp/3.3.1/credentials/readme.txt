The sealer.jks file will be generated by the FAT framework code each time the server starts up.
We've hit a problem running with Oracle JDKs.  They can't read the secret key's generated
by an IBM JDK.
So, we'll generate the sealer.jks before starting the server using the keytool on the test
system.  That way, it should be readable by the test machine's JDK.
(rumor has it that IBM jdk's can't read Oracle secret keys either)...
