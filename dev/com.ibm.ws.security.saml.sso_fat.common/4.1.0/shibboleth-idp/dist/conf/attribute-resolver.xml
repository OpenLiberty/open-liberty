<!-- 
This file is a rudimentary example. While it is semi-functional, it isn't very
interesting. It is here only as a starting point for your deployment process
to avoid any dependency on components like an LDAP directory.

Very few attribute definitions and data connectors are demonstrated, and the
data is derived statically from the logged-in username and a static example
connector.

The file(s) in the examples directory contain more examples that involve more
complex approaches. Deployers should refer to the documentation for a complete
list of possible components and their options.
