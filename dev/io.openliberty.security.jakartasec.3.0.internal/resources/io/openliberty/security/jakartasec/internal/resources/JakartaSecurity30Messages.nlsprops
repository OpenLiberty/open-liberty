JAKARTASEC_WARNING_OIDC_MECH_CONFIG=CWWKS2500W: The Expression Language (EL) expression for the {0} attribute of the OpenID authentication mechanism definition annotation cannot be resolved to a valid value. The value provided was ''{1}''. Ensure that the EL expression and the result are valid and ensure that any referenced beans that are used in the expression are resolvable. The default attribute value of ''{2}'' is used.
JAKARTASEC_WARNING_OIDC_MECH_CONFIG.explanation=The attribute cannot be resolved as an expression. The EL result and the expected attribute value type might be mismatched. For example, if the expected attribute type is String, then the EL result must be a String.
JAKARTASEC_WARNING_OIDC_MECH_CONFIG.useraction=Make sure that the annotation contains a valid configuration value. Ensure that the EL expressions are valid, that any referenced beans in the expression are resolvable, and that the type of the result corresponds with the attribute.

JAKARTASEC_WARNING_CLAIM_DEF_CONFIG=CWWKS2501W: The Expression Language (EL) expression for the {0} attribute of the claims definition annotation cannot be resolved to a valid value. The value provided was ''{1}''. Ensure that the EL expression and the result are valid and ensure that any referenced beans that are used in the expression are resolvable. The default attribute value of ''{2}'' is used.
JAKARTASEC_WARNING_CLAIM_DEF_CONFIG.explanation=The attribute cannot be resolved as an expression. The EL result and the expected attribute value type might be mismatched. For example, if the expected attribute type is String, then the EL result must be a String.
JAKARTASEC_WARNING_CLAIM_DEF_CONFIG.useraction=Make sure that the annotation contains a valid configuration value. Ensure that the EL expressions are valid, that any referenced beans in the expression are resolvable, and that the type of the result corresponds with the attribute.

JAKARTASEC_WARNING_LOGOUT_DEF_CONFIG=CWWKS2502W: The Expression Language (EL) expression for the {0} attribute of the logout definition annotation cannot be resolved to a valid value. The value provided was ''{1}''. Ensure that the EL expression and the result are valid and ensure that any referenced beans that are used in the expression are resolvable. The default attribute value of ''{2}'' is used.
JAKARTASEC_WARNING_LOGOUT_DEF_CONFIG.explanation=The attribute cannot be resolved as an expression. The EL result and the expected attribute value type might be mismatched. For example, if the expected attribute type is String, then the EL result must be a String.
JAKARTASEC_WARNING_LOGOUT_DEF_CONFIG.useraction=Make sure that the annotation contains a valid configuration value. Ensure that the EL expressions are valid, that any referenced beans in the expression are resolvable, and that the type of the result corresponds with the attribute.

JAKARTASEC_WARNING_PROV_METADATA_CONFIG=CWWKS2503W: The Expression Language (EL) expression for the {0} attribute of the OpenID provider metadata annotation cannot be resolved to a valid value. The value provided was ''{1}''. Ensure that the EL expression and the result are valid and ensure that any referenced beans that are used in the expression are resolvable. The default attribute value of ''{2}'' is used.
JAKARTASEC_WARNING_PROV_METADATA_CONFIG.explanation=The attribute cannot be resolved as an expression. The EL result and the expected attribute value type might be mismatched. For example, if the expected attribute type is String, then the EL result must be a String.
JAKARTASEC_WARNING_PROV_METADATA_CONFIG.useraction=Make sure that the annotation contains a valid configuration value. Ensure that the EL expressions are valid, that any referenced beans in the expression are resolvable, and that the type of the result corresponds with the attribute.

CREDENTIAL_VALIDATION_ERROR=CWWKS2504E: The {0} OpenID Connect client encountered the following error while validating the credential for the authenticated user: {1}
CREDENTIAL_VALIDATION_ERROR.explanation=The OpenID Connect client encountered an error while validating the tokens that were returned from the OpenID Connect provider, or an error occurred while using the information in the tokens to build the credential.
CREDENTIAL_VALIDATION_ERROR.useraction=For more information, see the error in the message.

JAKARTASEC_WARNING_MISSING_SUBJECT_CLAIMS=CWWKS2505W: The claims JSON object in the OpenIdContext bean cannot add the subject value for client {0} because subject value is missing from the OpenIdClaims object. 
JAKARTASEC_WARNING_MISSING_SUBJECT_CLAIMS.explanation=The OpenIdClaims object on the OpenIdContext bean is missing the required subject value. Therefore, the subject value of the claims JSON object cannot be set.  
JAKARTASEC_WARNING_MISSING_SUBJECT_CLAIMS.useraction=Review the logs for earlier errors related to OpenID authentication.

JAKARTASEC_CLAIMS_PROCESSING_ERROR=CWWKS2506E: The OpenID Connect client {0} Claims key value is incorrect. The value is {1} and the expected type is {2}. The error is {3}.
JAKARTASEC_CLAIMS_PROCESSING_ERROR.explanation=The OpenID Connect client encountered an error while verifying the expected type of fields on the OpenID Claims object. A frequent error is that the actual type of the returned value does not match the expected type.
JAKARTASEC_CLAIMS_PROCESSING_ERROR.useraction=For more information, see the error in the message.

JAKARTASEC_WARNING_OIDC_MECH_CONFIG_NEGATIVE_INT=CWWKS2507W: The {0} attribute of the OpenID authentication mechanism definition annotation must not be a negative integer. If the attribute is an Expression Language (EL) expression, it must not resolve to a negative integer. The value provided was ''{1}''. The default attribute value of ''{2}'' is used.
JAKARTASEC_WARNING_OIDC_MECH_CONFIG_NEGATIVE_INT.explanation=The attribute must not be a negative integer. If the attribute is an EL expression, the attribute must not resolve to a negative integer.
JAKARTASEC_WARNING_OIDC_MECH_CONFIG_NEGATIVE_INT.useraction=Update the attribute to use a non-negative integer. If the attribute an EL expression, update the referenced bean to resolve a non-negative integer.
