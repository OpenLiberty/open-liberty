/**
 * The TargetableCommand interface describes a command that can be run in a
 * remote JVM. It extends the Command interface and declares methods that
 * support remote execution of commands. Some of the methods are implemented
 * in the TargetableCommandImpl class, and some must be implemented by the
 * application programmer.</p>
 * <p>
 * A targetable command must have a target, which represents the server
 * that will actually run the command. The target object is an instance of the
 * CommandTarget interface, and it is responsible for ensuring that the
 * command runs in the desired server environment. For each server, there
 * is at least one class that implements the CommandTarget interface.</p>
 * <p>
 * The TargetableCommand interface provides two ways for a client to specify
 * the target of a command:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The target object can be set directly on the command by using
 *     the setCommandTarget() method.</li>
 * <li>The name of the target object can be set on the command by
 *     using the setCommandTargetName() method.</li>
 * </ul></p>
