 * The CompensableCommand interface allows you to make a command reversible.
 * When you make a command compensable, you associate a second command
 * with it. The second command compensates for the effects of the first
 * command by undoing its work as completely as possible.</p>
 * <p>
 * The CompensableCommand interface defines one method, getCompensatingCommand(),
 * which returns the compensating command associated with a command. The
 * application programmer must implement both this method and the compensating
 * command itself as part of implementing a compensable command.</p>
 * <p>
 * A client that wants to reverse a compensable command calls the compensating
 * command like this:
 * <pre>
 *       myCommand.getCompensatingCommand().performExecute();
 * </pre></p>
