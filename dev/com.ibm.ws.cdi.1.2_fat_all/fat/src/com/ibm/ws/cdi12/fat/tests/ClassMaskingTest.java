/**
 * This test ensures that if a class in one module is masked by a class in another module, CDI doesn't break.
 * <p>
 * The test was introduced because CDI was assuming that all classes present in a module should be loaded by that modules classloader. However, they could be loaded from another
 * module which is on the application classpath.
 * <p>
 * We also test that beans in an App Client jar are not visible to other modules.
