     * A more advanced test of CDI in the app client, which tests decorators, interceptors and event observers in the client container.
     * <p>
     * Test implementation details:
     * <ul>
     * <li>There are two implementations of the Greeter interface and we use qualifiers to select which one we want. We check both beans are called.</li>
     * <li>We have a decorator which decorates Greeters and we check that it modifies the return value correctly.</li>
     * <li>We have an interceptor which counts how often a @Countable method is called, we check the total is correct.</li>
     * <li>When a warning level is reached on the counter, it fires an event which is logged by an observer. We check for the observer's log message.</li>
     * </ul>
