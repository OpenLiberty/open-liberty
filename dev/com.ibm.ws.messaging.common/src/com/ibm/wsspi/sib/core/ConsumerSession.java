/**
 A ConsumerSession is used to receive messages from a Destination. It can be
 regarded as representing a Destination "opened for get".
 <p>
 A ConsumerSession essentially has two states (or three if you count the closed
 state): When an AynchConsumerCallback is registered, synchronous receipt is not
 permitted (InvalidStateForOperationException is thrown); when an
 AsynchConsumerCallback is not registered, asynchronous receipt is not possible
 and the related methods on ConsumerSession throw the exception. The initial
 state of a newly created ConsumerSession is "stopped".
 <p>
 Optionally, a ConsumerSession may use a "discriminator", specified on the
 createConsumerSession call. If provided, the discriminator is matched against
 the discriminator used by Producers when sending, and only matching messages
 are returned. Normally a discriminator is specified when consuming from a
 publish/subscribe destination, indicating the set of topics that consumer is
 interested in. If a consumer to a publish/subscribe destination does not
 specify a discriminator, then it will receive all publications sent to the
 destination. If the consumer specifies the empty string, then the consumer
 will receive only messages published to the special topic at the root of the
 hierarchy; that is, it will receive only messages published with no
 discriminator. When consuming from point-to-point destinations, the
 discriminator is normally left unspecified (null or the empty string is
 passed). If a discriminator is specified, this narrows the set of messages
 received to only those published with a matching discriminator (just as if the
 discriminator had been specified as part of a selector string).
 <p>
 This class has no direct security implications. Security checks are applied at
 the time that a ConsumerSession is created, see the SICoreConnection
 class for details.

   Registers a callback to which messages can be delivered asynchronously, and
   causes the ConsumerSession to transition from synchronous to asynchronous
   delivery mode. The client must implement the AsynchronousConsumerCallback
   interface, the consumeMessages method of which is called when messages are
   available for this consumer. The Core API implementation will assign up to
   maxBatchSize messages to the consumer per invocation of consumeMessages.
   <p>
   registerAsynchConsumerCallback may only be called on a stopped
   ConsumerSession; otherwise, SIIncorrectCallException is thrown.
   <p>
   If the ConsumerSession is already in asynchronous mode, then calling
   registerAsynchConsumerCallback deregisters the existing callback and replaces
   it with that supplied on the call.
   <p>
   maxActiveMessages sets a limit on the number of messages that may be assigned
   to the consumer at any time. A message is assigned to the consumer if it is
   locked, or if the consumer has issued a delete call for the message, with a
   transaction that has not yet completed (committed or rolled back). Once this
   limit is reached, the Core SPI implementation will cease delivering messages
   to the consumer until some are unlocked or committed (deleted) or rolledback.
   <p>
   Note that undeleted messages may remain locked to the consumer even after a call to
   consumeMessages on the registered callback returns if they have been viewed
   by the callback (LockedMEssageEnumeration.nextLocked has returned the message).
   If they have not been viewed the messages will be unlocked by the system once
   consumeMessages returns without incrementing the RedeliveredCount of the message.
   <p>
   maxBatchSize determines the maximum number of messages that may be delivered
   to a consumer in a single call to AsynchConsumerCallback.consumeMessages. A value
   maxActiveMessages = 0 is interpreted to mean that the consumer places no
   limit on the number of active messages (any configured limit would still
   apply). If 0 < maxActiveMessages < maxBatchSize, then the effective maximum
   batch size will be maxActiveMessages.
   <p>
   messageLockExpiry may be used to set the number of milliseconds after which
   messages locked to the consumer may be automatically unlocked and made
   available for redelivery. A value of zero is interpreted to mean that locks
   should not expire. It is required by z/OS, because messages may be queued
   for processing by a servant, but never actually processed or deleted, due to
   failure of the servant to which they have been assigned. Because the failure
   of the servant does not cause failure of the process with the original
   ConsumerSession, the messages are not automatically unlocked, as is the case
   in a single-process architecture. The expire of a message lock is not
   considered a failed delivery; it does not affect the RedeliveredCount
   property of the message, and does not count towards the maxFailedDeliveries
   limit of the destination.
   <p>
   The extendedMessageOrderingContext parameter may be used to indicate that
   message delivery should be ordered across multiple ConsumerSessions.
   Normally (for clients other than the JMS implementation) this parameter
   should be set to null.

   @param callback the object to which messages will be delivered
   asynchronously
   @param maxActiveMessages the maximum number of unconsumed messages that may
   be assigned to this consumer. This value ONLY takes effect if the session is bifurcatable
   @param messageLockExpiry the number of milliseconds after which locked
   messages may be returned to the unassigned state and removed from the LockedMessageEnumeration
   @param maxBatchSize the maximum number of messages that may be delivered at
   a time to the callback objects consumeMessages method

    call to AsynchConsumerCallback.consumeMessages. A value
    maxActiveMessages = 0 is interpreted to mean that the consumer places no
    limit on the number of active messages (any configured limit would still

    The maxSequentialFailures parameter is used to indicate when the asynch
    consumer callback object will be told that the consumer session has been
    stopped. A sequential failure is one when a message has failed to be consumer 
    upto (but not including) its max retry count. The maxSequentialFailures 
    indicates how many messages that sequentially failure in this way are 
    allowed till the consumer is stopped.
    <p> If maxSequentialFailures is a positive value a hiddenMessageDelay value
    may be specified. This is the time in milliseconds that a message that has
    rolled back will stay 'hidden' for before being re-available for consumption.
    This delay is applied on each rollback of the message prior to the message
    reaching its maximum retry limit, once that limit is reached the message will be
    exceptioned or the queue will become blocked, as under normal behaviour.
