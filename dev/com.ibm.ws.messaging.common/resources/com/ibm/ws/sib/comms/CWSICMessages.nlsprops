# File com.ibm.ws.sib.comms.CWSICMessages.props
#
# SIB.comms component file for logging _external_ messages
#
# These messages will be formatted as follows to enable translation and problem determination key values
#
# # {0} description of each insert field
# MSG_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME_CWSIC0001=CWSIC0001I: This is a message.
# #EXPLANATION explanation text for the message
# #USERACTION user action text for the message
#
# Instructions to translation will precede the line to which it applies
#
# Please note that the message prefix changed near the end of the development cycle and as such,
# while the messages have the right prefix, their keys may use the old. New messages should use
# the new prefix in the message and the key.
#
# Some of the messages in this file are processed as
# "java.text.MessageFormat" patterns and so use the apostrophe "'" and
# open brace "{" as special characters.
#
# If you are using the IBMJDK21 markup table to translate this file,
# type apostrophe characters as you wish them to appear to the user.
# The translation tools will automatically handle whether one or two
# apostrophes characters are required when the translated file is
# exported. See the following page for more details:
#
#  http://w3.ibm.com/ux/site.nsf/g/publish/2089#IBMJDK21
#
# If you are using the IBMJDK11 markup table or are a developer working
# with this file in a text editor, use the following rules for
# apostrophe characters:
#  a) If there are inserts in the message, for example "{0}", then
#     type two apostrophe characters, that is "''".
#  b) If there are no inserts, then just type a single apostrophe.
# Examples:
#  a) message.xml.parserError.prefix=UDUT0036E: Erreur de l''analyseur syntaxique : {0}
#  b) error.getAuthInfoFailed=UDUT0078E: Impossible d'obtenir authinfo.

MQLINK_DC_CHANGE_RCVR_SICO3355.explanation=WebSphere MQ link receiver instances only pick up configuration settings when starting up. Thus any configuration changes made to a running WebSphere MQ link will not effect running WebSphere MQ link receiver instances.
MQLINK_DC_CHANGE_RCVR_SICO3355.useraction=If you wish the running WebSphere MQ link receiver instances to use the latest configuration changes then they either need to all be stopped before the changes are made, or they need to be stopped and restarted to pick up the changed configuration.

MQLINK_DC_CHANGE_SNDR_SICO3356=CWSIC3356I: The system administrator has changed the configuration of WebSphere MQ link {0} which affects the running WebSphere MQ link sender {1}. The changes will only be picked up when the WebSphere MQ link sender goes through starting state or has been explicitly stopped and restarted.
MQLINK_DC_CHANGE_SNDR_SICO3356.explanation=WebSphere MQ link senders pick up most configuration settings when going through the starting state. Thus, if a configuration change occurs, the changes are only picked up when the WebSphere MQ link sender next enters the starting state. This can be achieved by administratively stopping and starting the WebSphere MQ link sender, or changes will be picked up when the WebSphere MQ link sender next enters the starting state, perhaps due to retries occurring or the disconnect interval being reached.
MQLINK_DC_CHANGE_SNDR_SICO3356.useraction=If you want the WebSphere MQ link sender to use the latest configuration changes, either stop the MQ link sender before making the changes, or stop and restart the MQ link sender to pick up the new configuration.
