# 
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# File com.ibm.ws.sib.example.CWSISMessages.nlsprops
#
# These messages will be formatted as follows to enable translation and problem determination key values
#
# # {0} description of each insert field
# MSG_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME_SInn0001=CWSIS0001I: This is a message with insert {0}
# MSG_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME_SInn0001.explanation=Explanation text for the message
# MSG_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME_SInn0001.useraction=User action text for the message
#
# Instructions to translation will precede the line to which it applies
#
# Some of the messages in this file are processed as
# "java.text.MessageFormat" patterns and so use the apostrophe "'" and
# open brace "{" as special characters.
#
# If you are using the IBMJDK21 markup table to translate this file,
# type apostrophe characters as you wish them to appear to the user.
# The translation tools will automatically handle whether one or two
# apostrophes characters are required when the translated file is
# exported. See the following page for more details:
#
#  http://w3.ibm.com/ux/site.nsf/g/publish/2089#IBMJDK21
#
# If you are using the IBMJDK11 markup table or are a developer working
# with this file in a text editor, use the following rules for
# apostrophe characters:
#  a) If there are inserts in the message, for example "{0}", then
#     type two apostrophe characters, that is "''".
#  b) If there are no inserts, then just type a single apostrophe.
# Examples: 
#  a) message.xml.parserError.prefix=UDUT0036E: Erreur de l''analyseur syntaxique : {0} 
#  b) error.getAuthInfoFailed=UDUT0078E: Impossible d'obtenir authinfo.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Notes:
# I have allocated ranges of message ids (500 messages each) so we can avoid tripping over each other.
# If you need a new range - just allocate it (but check no-one has it already).
#
#   - Msgs in the range CWSIS0000-CWSIS0499 belong to the interface stuff (eg PTvL)
#   - Msgs in the range CWSIS0500-CWSIS0999 belong to the core implementation stuff (eg PTvL)
#   - Msgs in the range CWSIS1000-CWSIS1499 belong to the transaction stuff (eg GB)
#   - Msgs in the range CWSIS1500-CWSIS1999 belong to the persistence stuff (eg BTD)
#   - Msgs in the range CWSIS2000-CWSIS2499 belong to the expiry stuff (eg KC)
#
#   - CWSIS9999 is for emergency use if any new messages are required after the messages file is finalised

# Messages CWSIS1593 & CWSIS1594 introduced to replace message CWSIS1546 which is ambiguous
# {0} the messaging engine UUID
# {1} the incarnation UUID
#DBLOCK_FAILED_SIMS1593=CWSIS1593I: The messaging engine, ME_UUID={0}, INC_UUID={1}, has failed to gain an initial lock on the data store.
#DBLOCK_FAILED_SIMS1593.explanation=The messaging engine, identified by the UUIDs in the message, has been unable to get an exclusive lock \
#                                   on the database tables that hold its data. This could be due to another instance of the messaging engine \
#                                   running against the same set of tables. It could also be the result of a lock from a previously running \
#                                   instance being held for longer than expected in the database. The messaging engine will retry for a \
#                                   period during startup to see if it is able to acquire the lock.
#DBLOCK_FAILED_SIMS1593.useraction=If the messaging engine does not succeed in acquiring the lock during the startup retry period then \
#                                  check that no other instance of the messaging engine is running and that there are no outstanding locks \
#                                 on the tables for this messaging engine being held on your database server.

# {0} the messaging engine UUID
# {1} the incarnation UUID
#DBLOCK_LOST_SIMS1594=CWSIS1594I: The messaging engine, ME_UUID={0}, INC_UUID={1}, has lost the lock on the data store.
#DBLOCK_LOST_SIMS1594.explanation=The messaging engine, identified by the UUIDs in the message, has lost an existing lock on the tables that \
#                                 hold its data. This may be due to a connectivity problem between the messaging engine and the database server \
#                                 or that another instance of the messaging engine has started and taken control of the tables.
#DBLOCK_LOST_SIMS1594.useraction=Check that a network connection between your messaging engine and database server is available and that there is \
#                               only one instance of the messaging engine running.

#DATASTORE_LOCK_DISABLED_CWSIS1597=CWSIS1597I: The data store exclusive lock has been disabled for {0} milliseconds.
#DATASTORE_LOCK_DISABLED_CWSIS1597.explanation=A request was made to disable the data store exclusive lock. The lock will remain disabled for the \
#                                              length of time stated in the message at which point it will re-enable automatically.
