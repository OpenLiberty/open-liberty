# File com.ibm.ws.sib.processor.CWSIPMessages.nlsprops
#
# SIB.processor component file for logging messages
#
# These messages will be formatted as follows to enable translation and problem determination key values
#
# # {0} description of each insert field
# MSG_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME_CWSIP0001=CWSIP0001I: This is a message.
# #EXPLANATION explanation text for the message
# #USERACTION user action text for the message
#
# Instructions to translation will precede the line to which it applies
#
# Some of the messages in this file are processed as
# "java.text.MessageFormat" patterns and so use the apostrophe "'" and
# open brace "{" as special characters.
#
# If you are using the IBMJDK21 markup table to translate this file,
# type apostrophe characters as you wish them to appear to the user.
# The translation tools will automatically handle whether one or two
# apostrophes characters are required when the translated file is
# exported. See the following page for more details:
#
#  http://w3.ibm.com/ux/site.nsf/g/publish/2089#IBMJDK21
#
# If you are using the IBMJDK11 markup table or are a developer working
# with this file in a text editor, use the following rules for
# apostrophe characters:
#  a) If there are inserts in the message, for example "{0}", then
#     type two apostrophe characters, that is "''".
#  b) If there are no inserts, then just type a single apostrophe.
# Examples:
#  a) message.xml.parserError.prefix=UDUT0036E: Erreur de l''analyseur syntaxique : {0}
#  b) error.getAuthInfoFailed=UDUT0078E: Impossible d'obtenir authinfo.

HEALTHSTATE_STATUS_CWSIP0913.explanation=The message transmitter has reached the messaging engine's high message threshold. The message backlog may be due to the receiving messaging engine not currently accepting messages or the rate of message production exceeding the capability to transmit the messages.
HEALTHSTATE_STATUS_CWSIP0913.useraction=Ensure the messaging engines that are communicating are active and have a network connection between them. If this state persists reduce the rate of message production if appropriate or check the system logs for errors.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HEALTHSTATE_STATUS_CWSIP0914=CWSIP0914W: Inefficient message delivery has been observed, due to re-delivering messages.
HEALTHSTATE_STATUS_CWSIP0914.explanation=One or more messages have required re-delivery to the receiving messaging engine, this is acceptable but not efficient. Possible reasons for requiring re-delivery are when the connection with the target messaging engine is lost or intermittent, or the rate of message production is exceeding the capability to transmit them.
HEALTHSTATE_STATUS_CWSIP0914.useraction=Ensure the messaging engines that are communicating are active and have a network connection between them. If this state persists reduce the rate of message production if appropriate or check the system logs for errors.

HEALTHSTATE_STATUS_CWSIP0916=CWSIP0916W: Inefficient message delivery has been observed, due to re-delivering messages.
HEALTHSTATE_STATUS_CWSIP0916.explanation=Re-delivery of messages is acceptable but not efficient. Possible reasons for requiring re-delivery are that the connection with the source messaging engine is lost or intermittent, or the rate of message production is exceeding the capability to receive them.
HEALTHSTATE_STATUS_CWSIP0916.useraction=Ensure the messaging engines that are communicating are active and have a network connection between them. If this state persists reduce the rate of message production if appropriate or check the system logs for errors.

HEALTHSTATE_STATUS_CWSIP0917=CWSIP0917W: Re-establishing message delivery
HEALTHSTATE_STATUS_CWSIP0917.explanation=A break in message transmission has been observed and is being resolved, possibly due to a break in communication or the rate of message production has exceeded the capability to receive them.
HEALTHSTATE_STATUS_CWSIP0917.useraction=Ensure the messaging engines that are communicating are active and have a network connection between them. If this state persists reduce the rate of message production if appropriate or check the system logs for errors.
