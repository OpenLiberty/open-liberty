# Message component file for Exception messages
#
# These messages will be formatted as follows to enable translation and problem determination key values
#
# # {0} description of each insert field
# MSG_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME_SIRC0001=CWSIK0001I: This is a message.
# #EXPLANATION explanation text for the message
# #USERACTION user action text for the message
#
# Instructions to translation will precede the line to which it applies
#
# Some of the messages in this file are processed as
# "java.text.MessageFormat" patterns and so use the apostrophe "'" and
# open brace "{" as special characters.
#
# If you are using the IBMJDK21 markup table to translate this file,
# type apostrophe characters as you wish them to appear to the user.
# The translation tools will automatically handle whether one or two
# apostrophes characters are required when the translated file is
# exported. See the following page for more details:
#
#  http://w3.ibm.com/ux/site.nsf/g/publish/2089#IBMJDK21
#
# If you are using the IBMJDK11 markup table or are a developer working
# with this file in a text editor, use the following rules for
# apostrophe characters:
#  a) If there are inserts in the message, for example "{0}", then
#     type two apostrophe characters, that is "''".
#  b) If there are no inserts, then just type a single apostrophe.
# Examples:
#  a) message.xml.parserError.prefix=UDUT0036E: Erreur de l''analyseur syntaxique : {0}
#  b) error.getAuthInfoFailed=UDUT0078E: Impossible d'obtenir authinfo.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Notes:
#   - All msgs are for use by the Exception Destination mechanism. These messages
#       - will be exposed to the user when a message cannot be delivered.
#
#   - Developers: Please ensure that every message in this message file is
#       - only used once. Servicability requirements mean we need to be able
#       - determine exactly who decided to reroute a message to the exception
#       - destination. In addition, please ensure that you add as much useful
#       - information as possible. Remember that the exception destination
#       - may be on a different server.
#
#		**** IMPORTANT ***
#       Please ensure EVERY message added has a corresponding reason code
#		in com/ibm/websphere/sib/SIRCConstants.java

# {1} is the bus from the message originated
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_44=CWSIK0044E: A message could not be delivered to destination {0} as the queue point for that destination is held on a WebSphere MQ server bus member and the message has been sent from foreign bus {1}.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_44.explanation=Messages can not be sent from a foreign bus directly to a destination whose queue point is held on WebSphere MQ and accessed using a WebSphere MQ server bus member. 
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_44.useraction=Either reconfigure the sending application to connect to the local bus or allow the WebSphere MQ destination to be accessed using a WebSphere MQ foreign bus connection and route the message via the foreign bus rather than via a WebSphere MQ server bus member.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ALIAS_TARGET_DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND_EXCEPTION_CWSIP0057
# {0} is the alias destination name
# {1} is the target destination name
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_45=CWSIK0045E: The alias destination {0} cannot be resolved because the target destination {1} does not exist.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_45.explanation=The target destination is not available in the local messaging engine.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_45.useraction=Specify the correct target destination.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# {0} identifies the message that has been rerouted
# {1} identifies the destination to which the message was rerouted
# {2} identifies the mediation that caused the message to be rerouted
# {3} identifies the destination at which the message was mediated
# {4} identifies the exception that mediation generated that caused the message to be rerouted
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_101=CWSIK0101W: The message {0} has been re-routed to the exception destination {1} because the mediation {2} at destination {3} caused the exception {4}.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_101.explanation=The message was given to the specified mediation; that mediation generated an exception and as a result, the message has been rerouted to the exception destination.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_101.useraction=If the mediation should not have rerouted the message, investigate the cause of the exception.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# {0} identifies the message that has been rerouted
# {1} identifies the mediation that caused the message to become invalid
# {2} identifies the destination at which the message was mediated
# {3} identifies the message format to which the message does not conform
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_102=CWSIK0102E: The message {0} cannot progress further along its forward routing path after being mediated by mediation {1} at destination {2} because the message does not conform to the message format {3}.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_102.explanation=After being mediated by the specified mediation, the message does not conform to the message format specified. The mediation has either changed the message contents, changed the message format, or both of these. The original version of the message has been rerouted to the exception destination.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_102.useraction=Investigate how and why the specified mediation has modified the message so that it does not conform to the specified message format.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# {0} identifies the message that has been rerouted
# {1} identifies the mediation that caused the message to become invalid
# {2} identifies the destination at which the message was mediated
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_103=CWSIK0103E: The message {0} cannot progress further along its forward routing path after being mediated by mediation {1} at destination {2} because the message is not well formed.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_103.explanation=After being mediated by the specified mediation, the message properties contained objects that could not be serialized, or the data graph is not valid.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_103.useraction=Investigate how and why the specified mediation has modified the message so that it is no longer valid.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_104=CWSIK0104E: The message is too big to be handled by remote MQ; sending to exception destination: message size {0}, maximum message size {1}.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_104.explanation=The message is too big.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_104.useraction=Check the MQ settings.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_105=CWSIK0105E: There is a message format error.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_105.explanation=The message cannot be processed because of a format error.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_105.useraction=Check the connection.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# {0} identifies the WebSphere MQ return code
# {1} identifies the WebSphere MQ reason code
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_106=CWSIK0106E: WebSphere MQ has raised an error. The WebSphere MQ return and reason codes are {0} and {1}, respectively.  
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_106.explanation=The message cannot be processed due to an error condition raised by WebSphere MQ.  
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_106.useraction=Examine the WebSphere MQ return and reason codes, and the WebSphere MQ error logs, to determine the cause of the error. You may need to contact your WebSphere MQ administrator to help resolve the problem.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# {0} The class name of the Object which cannot be serialized.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_200=CWSIK0200E: An Object of class {0} has been set into the message payload but it cannot be serialized.
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_200.explanation=An Object Message sent with the producerDoesNotModifyPayloadAfterSet flag enabled on its ConnectionFactory was sent with a payload that was not serializable by the system.  This message data has been lost
DELIVERY_ERROR_SIRC_200.useraction=Disable the producerDoesNotModifyPayloadAfterSet on the ConnectionFactory.  Without the flag enabled the JMS application which sets the object into the message will receive any serialization exception immediately.
