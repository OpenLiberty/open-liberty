no.injection.target.context.CWOWB1006E.explanation=CMSG0001

resource.producer.validation.error.CWOWB1007E=CWOWB1007E: The producer field, {0}, has type {1}, which does not match the type of the injected object.
resource.producer.validation.error.CWOWB1007E.explanation=CDI found a resource producer field where the type of the field did not match the type of the Java EE resource injected into it.
resource.producer.validation.error.CWOWB1007E.useraction=Ensure that the correct Java EE resource is being injected into the resource producer field and that the type of the field matches the type of the resource injected into it.

no.injection.target.CWOWB1008E=CWOWB1008E: The member {0} of class {1} cannot be injected as class {1} is not in a bean archive.
no.injection.target.CWOWB1008E.explanation=The injection is not successful as the bean manager of the archive that the class belongs to is null.
no.injection.target.CWOWB1008E.useraction=Ensure that the archive the class belongs to is a bean archive. Refer to the CDI specification on how to make an archive a bean archive.

implicit.bean.scanning.disabled.CWOWB1009W=CWOWB1009W: Implicit bean archives are disabled.
implicit.bean.scanning.disabled.CWOWB1009W.explanation=Archives are not scanned for CDI beans unless they have a beans.xml file.
implicit.bean.scanning.disabled.CWOWB1009W.useraction=Ensure that every archive that uses CDI has a beans.xml file or re-enable implicit beans scanning in your server.xml file.

spi.extension.failed.to.construct.CWOWB1010E=CWOWB1010E: Failed to create CDI Extension {0} with SPI because of the exception {1}.
spi.extension.failed.to.construct.CWOWB1010E.explanation=CDI failed to invoke the constructor of an extension class that is registered with the getExtensions() method of a CDIExtensionMetadata implementation.
spi.extension.failed.to.construct.CWOWB1010E.useraction=Fix the error that is preventing your extension from instantiating.

spi.extension.class.in.different.bundle.CWOWB1011E=CWOWB1011E: A {0} class registered through the CDI Extension SPI is in a different bundle than the CDIExtensionMetadata implementation.
spi.extension.class.in.different.bundle.CWOWB1011E.explanation=The class is ignored because it was registered with the getExtensions() or getBeanClasses() method of a CDIExtensionMetadata implementation and is in a different bundle than the CDIExtensionMetadata implementation.
spi.extension.class.in.different.bundle.CWOWB1011E.useraction=Move the affected class or create a new CDIExtensionMetadata implementation in the correct bundle.

exception.creating.extensions.CWOWB1012E=CWOWB1012E: CDI encountered an exception when it created extensions for the {0} archive. The error was: {1}
exception.creating.extensions.CWOWB1012E.explanation=CDI failed to load or invoke the construction of an extension class.
exception.creating.extensions.CWOWB1012E.useraction=Fix the error that is preventing the extension from being created.

bce.not.loadable.CWOWB1013E=CWOWB1013E: The {0} BuildCompatibleExtension class cannot not be loaded.
bce.not.loadable.CWOWB1013E.explanation=The application includes a META-INF/services/jakarta.enterprise.inject.build.compatible.spi.BuildCompatibleExtension file that includes the class, but CDI could not load the class.
bce.not.loadable.CWOWB1013E.useraction=Ensure the class is present in the application and can be loaded. If the class is present in the application, an FFDC file might have more information about why the class could not be loaded.

bce.does.not.implement.bce.CWOWB1014E=CWOWB1014E: The {0} class does not implement the BuildCompatibleExtension interface.
bce.does.not.implement.bce.CWOWB1014E.explanation=The application includes a META-INF/services/jakarta.enterprise.inject.build.compatible.spi.BuildCompatibleExtension file that includes the class, but the class does not implement jakarta.enterprise.inject.build.compatible.spi.BuildCompatibleExtension
bce.does.not.implement.bce.CWOWB1014E.useraction=Change the class so that it implements jakarta.enterprise.inject.build.compatible.spi.BuildCompatibleExtension.

cdi12.element.type.superceded.CWOWB1015I=CWOWB1015I: The cdi12 configuration element is superseded by the cdi configuration element.
cdi12.element.type.superceded.CWOWB1015I.explanation=The cdi configuration element replaces the cdi12 configuration element and contains all the same options, plus new options.
cdi12.element.type.superceded.CWOWB1015I.useraction=Change your server.xml configuration to use the cdi configuration element instead of the cdi12 configuration element.

#CWOWB1016W is not used - https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/21107

enableImplicitBeanArchives.conflict.CWOWB1017W=CWOWB1017W: The enableImplicitBeanArchives attribute was set on both cdi12 and cdi configuration elements. The value from the cdi element is used and the value in the cdi12 element is ignored.
enableImplicitBeanArchives.conflict.CWOWB1017W.explanation=Although you can set the enableImplicitBeanArchives attribute on both of the cdi12 and cdi configuration element configuration elements, you should not set this attribute with different values in the same server configuration.
enableImplicitBeanArchives.conflict.CWOWB1017W.useraction=Update your server.xml to fix the conflict. The recommended action is to remove the cdi12 configuration element because it is superseded by the cdi configuration element.

unversioned.beansXML.warning.CWOWB1018W=CWOWB1018W: Using an unversioned CDI beans.xml file might lead to unexpected behaviour when using CDI 4.0 or later: {0}
unversioned.beansXML.warning.CWOWB1018W.explanation=Prior to CDI 4.0, a non-empty but unversioned beans.xml file meant that the archive was treated as an explicit bean archive (all classes are eligible to be beans). In CDI 4.0 or later, the archive is taken to be an implicit bean archive (only annotated classes are eligible be beans).
unversioned.beansXML.warning.CWOWB1018W.useraction=Update the beans.xml file within your application to use a newer version of the schema and ensure that the version and bean-discovery-mode attributes are properly set.
