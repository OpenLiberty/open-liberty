# Cache config

cache.config=Distributed Map
cache.config.desc=Distributed map configuration for a local cache.

jndiName=JNDI name
jndiName.desc=JNDI name for a cache instance.

memorySizeInEntries=Memory cache size
memorySizeInEntries.desc=Specifies a positive integer that defines the maximum number of entries that the cache can hold. Values are usually in the thousands. The minimum value is 100, with no set maximum value. The default value is 2000.

memorySizeInMB=Memory cache size in megabytes
memorySizeInMB.desc=Specifies a value for the maximum memory cache size in megabytes (MB).

highThreshold=High threshold
highThreshold.desc=Specifies when the memory cache eviction policy starts. The threshold is expressed in terms of the percentage of the memory cache size in megabytes (MB).

lowThreshold=Low threshold
lowThreshold.desc=Specifies when the memory cache eviction policy ends. The threshold is expressed in terms of the percentage of the memory cache size in megabytes (MB).

servletResponseCaching=Replication type
servletResponseCaching.desc=Specifies the sharing policy of cached entries across application servers.

cacheProviderName=Cache provider
cacheProviderName.desc=Specifies the name of an alternate cache provider.

disk.config=Enable Disk Offload
disk.config.desc=Enable disk offload to specify that when the cache is full, cache entries are removed from the cache and saved to disk. The location is a fully-qualified directory location that is used by the disk offload function. The Flush to Disk on Stop option specifies that when the server stops, the contents of the memory cache are moved to disk.

sizeInEntries=Disk cache size
sizeInEntries.desc=Specifies a value for the maximum disk cache size, in number of entries.

sizeInGB=Disk cache size in gigabytes
sizeInGB.desc=Specifies a value for the maximum disk cache size, in gigabytes (GB).

evictionPolicy=Disk cache eviction policy
evictionPolicy.desc=Specifies the eviction algorithm and thresholds that the disk cache uses to evict entries. When the disk size reaches a high threshold limit, the disk cache garbage collector wakes up and evicts randomly-selected (Random) or the largest (Size) entries on the disk until the disk size reaches a low threshold limit.

random=Random

size=Size

diskHighThreshold=High threshold
diskHighThreshold.desc=Specifies when the eviction policy starts.

diskLowThreshold=Low threshold
diskLowThreshold.desc=Specifies when the eviction policy ends.

location=Disk offload location
location.desc=Specifies a directory to use for disk offload.

flushToDiskOnStop=Flush to disk
flushToDiskOnStop.desc=Set this value to true to have objects that are cached in memory saved to disk when the server stops. This value is ignored if Enable disk offload is set to false.

cacheGroup.config=External Cache Groups
cacheGroup.config.desc=Specifies sets of external caches that are controlled by WebSphere(R) Application Server on servers such as IBM(R) WebSphere(R) Edge Server and IBM(R) HTTP Server.

cacheGroup.name=Name
cacheGroup.name.desc=Specifies a unique name for the external cache group. The external cache group name must match the ExternalCache property that is defined in the servlet or Java(TM) Server Pages (JSP) cachespec.xml file.

member.config=External Cache Group Member
member.config.desc=Members of an external cache group that are controlled by WebSphere Application Server.

host=Host name
host.desc=Fully qualified host name

port=Port
port.desc=Port.

adapterBeanName=Adapter bean name
adapterBeanName.desc=Specifies the name of a class, which is located on the WebSphere Application Server class path, of the adapter between WebSphere Application Server and this external cache.

libraryRef=Shared Library
libraryRef.desc=Specifies a reference to a shared library.
libraryRef$Ref=Shared library reference
