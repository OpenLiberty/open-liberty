CWWKC1158.cannot.lazy.enlist.beans=CWWKC1158E: You must access the CDI beans before context is captured for the contextual action or task so that the CDI \
beans behave correctly when accessed from the action or task. The following CDI beans were not accessed before the context was captured: {0}.
CWWKC1158.cannot.lazy.enlist.beans.explanation=When CDI context is captured, only CDI beans that have been accessed at that point in time have been created by \
the CDI runtime. As a result, CDI beans that are first accessed in contextual operations cannot propagate their state correctly to subsequent contextual operations.
CWWKC1158.cannot.lazy.enlist.beans.useraction=The application must be changed to invoke some CDI bean operation, such as a public method, before context for \
the operation is captured.
