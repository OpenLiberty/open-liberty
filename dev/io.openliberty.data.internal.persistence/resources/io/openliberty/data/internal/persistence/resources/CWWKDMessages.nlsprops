 repository method.
CWWKD1000.repo.general.err.useraction=Locate the repository interface and method \
 and determine whether corrections are needed.

CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity=CWWKD1001E: The {0} repository method requires \
 an entity class but the {1} repository interface does not specify a primary \
 entity class. To correct this error, the {1} repository interface can extend \
 one of the built-in repository supertypes, such as {2}, and supply the entity \
 class as the first type parameter.
CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity.explanation=Repository methods without an entity \
 class of their own require the repository to define a primary entity class.
CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity.useraction=Define a primary entity class for the \
 repository.

 interface is not valid. The method specifies a {2} return type that is \
 not convertible from the {3} entity type. The result type of a \
 find operation must be the entity type, a type of an entity property, \
 a Java record composed of entity properties, or a type constructed \
 by the JPQL or JDQL that is supplied to the \
 Query annotation. The return type of the repository find method can be \
 the result type, an array of the result type, or any of the following types \
 parameterized with the result type: {4}.
