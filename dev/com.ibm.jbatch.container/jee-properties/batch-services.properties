# This file is intended for configuration of the batch runtime by an integrator of
# the runtime into a particular project or environment.  E.g. this is not where
# you would perform a finer configuration of something like a thread pool size, but
# a more fundamental configuration, like do I want to use JDBC persistence (used by
# default) or in-memory persistence for the JobExecution tables.
