MISSING_SEC_ROLE_REF_ROLE_LINK=CWWKS9100W: In servlet {0}, <security-role-ref> element for <role-name>{1}</role-name> is missing corresponding <role-link> element.
MISSING_SEC_ROLE_REF_ROLE_LINK.explanation=The <role-link> entry for the <security-role-ref> element is required to map the <role-name> to a real security role.
MISSING_SEC_ROLE_REF_ROLE_LINK.useraction=Define the missing <role-link> entry for the <security-role-ref> element.

INVALID_SEC_ROLE_REF_ROLE_LINK=CWWKS9101W: In servlet {0}, <role-link>{1}</role-link> for <role-name>{2}</role-name> is not a defined <security-role>.
INVALID_SEC_ROLE_REF_ROLE_LINK.explanation=The <role-link> entry for the <security-role-ref> element is required to map the <role-name> to a real security role.
INVALID_SEC_ROLE_REF_ROLE_LINK.useraction=Either create a <security-role> element for the <role-link> name, or change the <role-link> entry to name an existing the <security-role> name.

MULTIPLE_URL_PATTERN_DEFINED=CWWKS9102W: Multiple <url-pattern>{0}</url-pattern> defined for <servlet-name>{1}</servlet-name> and <servlet-name>{2}</servlet-name>.
MULTIPLE_URL_PATTERN_DEFINED.explanation=The <url-pattern> entry in the <servlet-mapping> element maps a specific <servlet-name> to the specified pattern. Using the same pattern creates an ambiguous mapping.
MULTIPLE_URL_PATTERN_DEFINED.useraction=Change the <url-pattern> to be unique.

AUTHZ_TABLE_NOT_CREATED=CWWKS9103E: The authorization table for the application {0} could not be created.
AUTHZ_TABLE_NOT_CREATED.explanation=The authorization table for an application was not created and therefore no users will be authorized.
AUTHZ_TABLE_NOT_CREATED.useraction=Examine the logs to determine why the authorization table was not created.

SEC_AUTHZ_FAILED=CWWKS9104A: Authorization failed for user {0} while invoking {1} on {2}. The user is not granted access to any of the required roles: {3}.
SEC_AUTHZ_FAILED.explanation=The user does not have the necessary permission to access the resource.
SEC_AUTHZ_FAILED.useraction=Contact your security administrator if this is unexpected. Your user must be mapped to one of the roles protecting the resource if access to the protected resource is required.

SSL_CAN_NOT_DETERMINE_PORT=CWWKS9105E: Could not determine the SSL port for automatic redirection. Check the logs to ensure that the HTTPS (SSL) port is started or for possible errors related to the SSL configuration such as a missing or incorrect keyStore element.
SSL_CAN_NOT_DETERMINE_PORT.explanation=An internal error occurred. The SSL port could not be determined.
SSL_CAN_NOT_DETERMINE_PORT.useraction=No action can be taken.

SEC_FORM_LOGIN_BAD_CONFIG=CWWKS9106E: SSO Configuration error. FormLogin is configured for web application {0} but SSO is not enabled in the security settings.  SSO must be enabled to use FormLogin.
SEC_FORM_LOGIN_BAD_CONFIG.explanation=When LTPA is the authentication mechanism, SSO must also be enabled if any web applications use FORM login.
SEC_FORM_LOGIN_BAD_CONFIG.useraction=Enable SSO in the security settings, then restart the application server.

SEC_TAI_VALIDATE_FAILED=CWWKS9107E: Trust Association Init is unable to load Trust Association class {0}.
SEC_TAI_VALIDATE_FAILED.explanation=When the appropriate interceptor is found for a given request, that interceptor then \
 validates its trust with the reverse proxy server. This error message  \
 suggests that the validation has failed and therefore the reverse \
 proxy cannot be trusted. For example, an incorrect or expired password might  \
 have been provided.
SEC_TAI_VALIDATE_FAILED.useraction=In a production environment, the user might be alerted to check \
 if there is an intruder in the system. In a development environment \
 in which testing is underway, verify that the expected inputs from the  \
 reverse proxy server are being passed to the interceptor correctly.  \
 The nature of these inputs depends on how trust association \
 is being established. For example, the simplest method is to  \
 pass a user name and password through the Basic Authentication header.  

SEC_TAI_USER_EXCEPTION=CWWKS9108E: Unable to find a valid user for Trust Association.
SEC_TAI_USER_EXCEPTION.explanation=An interceptor returns the authenticate user name. \
 No such user name was returned.
SEC_TAI_USER_EXCEPTION.useraction=Verify that the reverse proxy server is inserting the correct user name in the HTTP request before \
 it sends the request to the application server.

SEC_TAI_GENERAL_EXCEPTION=CWWKS9109E: An unexpected exception occurred during Trust Association. The exception is {0}.
SEC_TAI_GENERAL_EXCEPTION.explanation=This exception refers to all other exceptions that can be created by an interceptor, when validating \
 trust with the reverse proxy server and when getting the authenticated user name,  except for  \
 WebTrustAssociationFailedException and WebTrustAssociationUserException.
SEC_TAI_GENERAL_EXCEPTION.useraction=Debug the problem from the stack trace that is printed together with this error message. \
 You can also turn on the debug trace to get more information about the nature of the exception.

SSL_PORT_IS_NULL.explanation=The SSL port could not be determined, which prevented the incoming HTTP request from being redirected to the HTTPS port. This could happen if there is a configuration error in the keyStore element or the SSL feature is missing.
SSL_PORT_IS_NULL.useraction=Ensure that you have the correct SSL information in server.xml.

SSL_REQ_URL_MALFORMED_EXCEPTION=CWWKS9114E: The incoming http request cannot be redirected to a secure port because the servlet request URL {0} is malformed. Ensure the request URL is correct.
SSL_REQ_URL_MALFORMED_EXCEPTION.explanation=The servlet request URL is malformed, which prevented the incoming HTTP request from being redirected to the HTTPS port.
SSL_REQ_URL_MALFORMED_EXCEPTION.useraction=Ensure the servlet request URL is correct.

GETFORMLOGOUTEXTENSIONPROCESSOR_EXCEPTION.useraction=CMSG0002

AUTHENTICATE_CACHE_REMOVAL_EXCEPTION=CWWKS9119W: Logging out user {0} did not complete successfully because an unexpected exception occurred while removing the user''s cookies from the authentication cache. Exception is {1}. Review the server logs for more information, and the log the user out again if possible.
AUTHENTICATE_CACHE_REMOVAL_EXCEPTION.explanation=Logging out the user did not complete successfully because an unexpected exception occurred removing the user's cookies from the authentication cache.
AUTHENTICATE_CACHE_REMOVAL_EXCEPTION.useraction=Review the server logs for more information, and log the user out again if possible. If the problem persists, see problem determination information on the WebSphere Application Server Support page at http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/was/support/.

SEC_JACC_AUTHZ_FAILED.explanation=The user does not have the necessary permission to access the resource. This authorization decision was made by the user-defined Java Authorization Contract for Containers (JACC) provider.  
SEC_JACC_AUTHZ_FAILED.useraction=Contact your security administrator if this is unexpected. Your user must be mapped to one of the roles protecting the resource if access to the protected resource is required. You can configure this authorization through the user-defined Java Authorization Contract for Containers (JACC) provider.


SEC_FORM_LOGOUTEXITPAGE_INVALID=CWWKS9125E: The URL provided on the custom logoutExitPage of the Form-Logout service can not be displayed, requestURL={0}, logoutExitPage={1}. The logout was successful and the default Form-Logout page was displayed.
