# {0} - the name of the library
# {1} - the location of the META-INF/services file, probably a URL that also indicates which jar it is in
# {2} - the name of the implementation class
bell.service.name=CWWKL0050I: The {0} library registered the service that is declared in the {1} file, using the {2} implementation class.
bell.service.name.explanation=The service was declared in the META-INF/services directory and the service was registered to the server.  
bell.service.name.useraction=No user action is required.

# {0} - the name of the implementation class
# {1} - the location of the META-INF/services file, probably a URL that also indicates which jar it is in
# {2} - the name of the library
bell.no.impl=CWWKL0051W: The system cannot locate the {0} implementation of the service that is declared in the {1} file and registered from the {2} library.
bell.no.impl.explanation=The implementation of the service was not found.
bell.no.impl.useraction=Make sure that the name that is specified in the service declaration is correct.

# {0} - the name of the implementation class
# {1} - the location of the META-INF/services file, probably a URL that also indicates which jar it is in
# {2} - the name of the library
# {3} - message from the NoClassDefFoundError
bell.no.inter=CWWKL0052W: The system cannot construct an instance of the {0} implementation class because of a missing class definition. This class is an implementation of the service that is declared in the {1} file and registered from the {2} library. The error is as follows: {3}.
bell.no.inter.explanation=A class that is required for the initialization of the service was not found.
bell.no.inter.useraction=Make sure that the name that is specified in the service declaration is correct. 

# {0} - the name of the implementation class
# {1} - the location of the META-INF/services file, probably a URL that also indicates which jar it is in
# {2} - the name of the library
bell.not.constructible=CWWKL0053W: The system cannot construct an instance of the {0} implementation class. This class is an implementation of the service that is declared in the {1} file and registered from the {2} library.
bell.not.constructible.explanation=The system cannot create an instance of the service implementation because there is no access to the class definition, or the class is missing a no argument constructor.
bell.not.constructible.useraction=Ensure that there is access to the class definition and the constructor.

# {0} - the name of the implementation class
# {1} - the location of the META-INF/services file, probably a URL that also indicates which jar it is in
# {2} - the name of the library
bell.illegal.access=CWWKL0054W: The system cannot construct an instance of the {0} implementation class due to unauthorized access. This class is an implementation of the service that is declared the {1} file and registered from the {2} library.
bell.illegal.access.explanation=The system cannot access the class declaration or the constructor.
bell.illegal.access.useraction=Ensure that that the class and constructor are defined and accessible.

# {0} - the name of the library
bell.no.services.found=CWWKL0055W: The system cannot find any services in the following library: {0}.
bell.no.services.found.explanation=There were no services declared in the META-INF/services folder.
bell.no.services.found.useraction=Ensure that the Basic Extensions using Liberty Libraries (BELL) is configured with the correct library that has the expected META-INF/services folder

# {0} - the location of the META-INF/services file, probably a URL that also indicates which jar it is in
# {1} - the name of the library
# {2} - the exception thrown when trying to read the file
bell.io.error=CWWKL0056W: An error occurred while reading the {0} file for exporting services from the {1} library. The error is: {2}
bell.io.error.explanation=The service declaration file is not readable.
bell.io.error.useraction=Ensure that the file is readable by the system.

# {0} - the name of the implementation class
# {1} - the location of the META-INF/services file, probably a URL that also indicates which jar it is in
# {2} - the name of the library
# {3} - the exception thrown when instantiating the class
bell.error.ctor=CWWKL0057W: The {0} instance was not created successfully. This class is an implementation of the service that is declared in the {1} file and registered from the {2} library. The following error occurred: {3}
bell.error.ctor.explanation=The system received an unexpected exception error during the creation of the instance. This error can occur as a result of an exception from the constructor of the class.
bell.error.ctor.useraction=If an exception occurred in the constructor, review and verify the behavior of the class constructor.

bell.no.services.config=CWWKL0058W: Cannot find the {0} service in META-INF/services folder from the {1} library.
bell.no.services.config.explanation=There is no matching service declared in the META-INF/services folder.
bell.no.services.config.useraction= No user action is required.

# {0} - library identifier
bell.spi.visibility.enabled=CWWKL0059I: BELL SPI visibility is enabled for the {0} library. The BELL references the {0} library through a unique class loader that can see SPI packages.
bell.spi.visibility.enabled.explanation=To prevent applications and resources from seeing SPI packages, the BELL references the library through a unique class loader that is not shared with applications that reference the same library.
bell.spi.visibility.enabled.useraction=Disable SPI visibility in the BELL configuration whenever the BELL must reference a library through a class loader that is shared with applications that reference the same library. Otherwise, no action is required.

bell.spi.visibility.disabled.libref.global=CWWKL0060E: BELL SPI visibility is not supported for the Liberty global shared library.
bell.spi.visibility.disabled.libref.global.explanation=BELL SPI visibility cannot be enabled for the Liberty global shared library.
bell.spi.visibility.disabled.libref.global.useraction=Modify the BELL configuration to reference a library other than the Liberty global shared library.

# {0} - the name of the implementation class
# {1} - the location of the META-INF/services file, probably a URL that also indicates which jar it is in
# {2} - the name of the library
bell.missing.property.injection.methods=CWWKL0062W: The system did not inject BELL properties into an instance of the {0} implementation. The class does not define a method that supports BELL property injection. The class is an implementation of the service that is declared in the {1} file and registered from the {2} library.
bell.missing.property.injection.methods.explanation=The system cannot access a method required for BELL property injection. The service implementation class must define a public constructor, or a public method named updateBell, with one parameter of type java.util.Map<string,String> in order to support BELL property injection.
bell.missing.property.injection.methods.useraction=Ensure that the class defines a public constructor, or a public method named updateBell, with a single parameter of type java.util.Map<String, String>.
