    <!-- Sample definition of an application with authorization bindings.
         The authorization bindings map roles defined in the deployment
         descriptor to users and groups in the registry. The application
         binding can also be established in the ibm-application-bnd.xml
         or the ibm-application-bnd.xmi which can be packaged within an
         EAR file.
         
         NOTE: the value of the access-id is optional. Setting the access-id
               value is only necessary when the realm of the user ID needs
               to be restricted. This is not normally necessary. -->
