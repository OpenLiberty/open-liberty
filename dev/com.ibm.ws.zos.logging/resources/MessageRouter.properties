# MessageRouter.properties file.
#
# This file has the format:
#
#       <message-ID>=(+|-)<LogHandler-ID>[,(+|-)<LogHandler-ID>] ...
#
# where:
#       <message-ID>     The first 10 chars of the message (e.g. "CWWKE0001I").
#       <LogHandler-ID>  The "id" property for a LogHandler ServiceReference.
#             +          Indicates the message should be routed to the LogHandler.
#             -          Indicates the message should NOT be routed to the LogHandler
# 
# If +/- isn't specified, the default is +.
#
# For example, com.ibm.ws.logging.zos defines two LogHandlers, id="WTO" and id="HARDCOPY".
#       
#       CWWKE0001I=+WTO,+HARDCOPY
#
# ...will route the message that begins with "CWWKE0001I" to both the WTO and HARDCOPY 
# LogHandlers (in addition to being logged by the normal logging mechanism (e.g console.log).
