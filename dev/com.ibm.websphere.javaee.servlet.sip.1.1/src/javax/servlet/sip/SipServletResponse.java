/**
 * Represents SIP responses. Instances of this class are passed to servlets
 * when the container receives incoming SIP responses and also, servlets
 * acting as UA servers or proxies generates SIP responses of their own by
 * creating <code>SipServletResponses</code>.
 * 
 * <p>SIP responses has a three-digit <em>status code</em> that indicates
 * the outcome of the corresponding request. Responses with a status code
 * in the range of 100-199 (1xx's) are called <em>provisional</em> or
 * <em>informational</em> and indicate progress in processing of the request.
 * Any response with a status code of 200 or higher is a <em>final</em>
 * response. A UA server may send only one final response per request
 * but this may be preceeded by any number of provisional responses.
 * 
 * <p>2xx responses indicate a successful outcome while 3xx-6xx indicate a
 * variety of non-success conditions.
 * 
 * <p>The summary of status codes is [RFC 3261]:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>1xx:</b> Informational -- request received, continuing to process
 * the request
 * <li><b>2xx:</b> Success -- the action was successfully received,
 * understood, and accepted
 * <li><b>3xx:</b> Redirection -- further action needs to be taken in
 * order to complete the request
 * <li><b>4xx:</b> Client Error -- the request contains bad syntax or
 * cannot be fulfilled at this server
 * <li><b>5xx:</b> Server Error -- the server failed to fulfill an
 * apparently valid request
 * <li><b>6xx:</b> Global Failure -- the request cannot be fulfilled at any
 * server
 * </ul>
