/**
 * Represents point-to-point SIP relationships. It roughly corresponds
 * to a SIP dialog. In particular, for UAs it maintains (or is otherwise
 * associated with) dialog state so as to be able to create subequent
 * requests belonging to that dialog (using {@link #createRequest
 * createRequest}).
 * 
 * <p>For UACs, <code>SipSession</code> extend the notion of SIP dialogs
 * to have well-defined state before a dialog has been established and
 * after a final non-2xx terminates an early dialog. This allows UACs to
 * create "subsequent" requests without having an established dialog. The
 * effect is that the subsequent request will have the same Call-ID,
 * From and To headers (with the same From tag and without a To tag),
 * the will exist in the same CSeq space.
 * 
 * <p>All messages are potentially associated with a <code>SipSession</code>.
 * The <code>SipSession</code> can be retrieved from the message by calling
 * {@link SipServletMessage#getSession()}.
