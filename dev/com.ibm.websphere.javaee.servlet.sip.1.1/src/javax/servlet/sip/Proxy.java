/**
 * Represents the operation of proxying a SIP request.
 * 
 * <p>A number of parameters control how proxying is carried out:
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>addToPath</b>:
 * <dd> addToPath: Whether the application adds a Path header to the REGISTER request. The default is false.
 * <dt><b>recurse</b>: 
 * <dd>Whether to autmotically recurse or not. The default is true.
 * 
 * <dt><b>recordRoute</b>: 
 * <dd>Whether to record-route or not. The default is false.
 * 
 * <dt><b>parallel</b>: 
 * <dd>Whether to proxy in parallel or sequentially. The default is true.
 * 
 * <dt><b>stateful</b>: 
 * <dd>Whether to remain transaction stateful for the duration of the
 *     proxying operation. The default is true.
 * 
 * <dt><b>supervised</b>: 
 * <dd>Whether the application will be invoked on incoming responses related to this proxying.
 * 
 * <dt><b>proxyTimeout</b>: 
 * <dd>The timeout for the proxy in general. In case the proxy is a sequential proxy
 * then this value behaves like the sequential-search-timeout
 * which is deprecated since v1.1. In case the proxy is a parallel proxy then this timeout acts as 
 * the timeout for the entire proxy i.e each of its parallel branches before it starts
 * to send out CANCELs waiting for final responses on all INVITE branches and sends the 
 * best final response upstream.  
 * 
 * <dt><b>sequentialSearchTimeout</b>:
 * <dd>The time the container waits for a final response before it CANCELs
 * the branch and proxies to the next destination in the target set. The usage of 
 * this explicit sequential timeout setting is <b>deprecated</b> and replaced by a general 
 * <code>proxyTimeout</code> parameter. 
 * </dl>
 * 
 * The effect of the various parameters is explained further below.
