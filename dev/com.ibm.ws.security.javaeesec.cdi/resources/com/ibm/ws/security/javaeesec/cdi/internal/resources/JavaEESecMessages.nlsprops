JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_MULTIPLE_HTTPAUTHMECHS=CWWKS1925E: The application deployment is failed because multiple HttpAuthenticationMechanism implementation are found. The list of classes is {0}. Most likely, this is an application packaging issue. Please make sure that there is only one HttpAuthenticationMechanism implementation in the application.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_MULTIPLE_HTTPAUTHMECHS.explanation=The application deployment is failed because more than one HttpAuthenticationMechanism implementation are found. This condition is not allowed.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_MULTIPLE_HTTPAUTHMECHS.useraction=Make sure that there is only one HttpAuthenticationMechanism implementation in the application.

JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_LOGIN_TO_CONTINUE_PROPERTIES_DOES_NOT_EXIST=CWWKS1926E: LoginToContinueProperties bean does not exist. The form login is not enabled. Please make sure that the application is annotated by LoginToContinue annotation.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_LOGIN_TO_CONTINUE_PROPERTIES_DOES_NOT_EXIST.explanation=LoginToContinueProperties bean which is required for the form login authentication does not exist.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_LOGIN_TO_CONTINUE_PROPERTIES_DOES_NOT_EXIST.useraction=Make sure that the application is annotated by LoginToContinue annotation in FormAuthenticationMechanismDefinition or CustomFormAuthenticationMechanismDefinition annotation.

JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_CRED=CWWKS1927E: The supplied credential class {0} is not supported by CustomFormHttpAuthenticationMechanism class. Use either javax.security.enterprise.credential.UsernamePasswordCredential or javax.security.enterprise.credential.BasicAuthenticationCredential for authentication.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_CRED.explanation=The supplied credential class for the authentication is not supported by CustomFormHttpAuthenticationMechanism class. Use either javax.security.enterprise.credential.UsernamePasswordCredential or javax.security.enterprise.credential.BasicAuthenticationCredential for authentication.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_CRED.useraction=Make sure that the supported credential class is used for Custom Form authentication.

JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_USERNAME_NULL=CWWKS1928E: Principal name is null or Principal object does not exist. Make sure that CredentialValidationResult contains valid Principal object.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_USERNAME_NULL.explanation=Principal object in the given CredentialValidationResult object is not valid. Either it is null or it does not have valid name.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_USERNAME_NULL.useraction=If the application provides an IdentityStore, make sure that it returns valid Principal object in CredentialValidationResult.

JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_UNIQUE_ID_NULL=CWWKS1929E: UniqueId is null. Make sure that CredentialValidationResult contains valid UniqueId.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_UNIQUE_ID_NULL.explanation=UniqueId in the given CredentialValidationResult object is null.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_UNIQUE_ID_NULL.useraction=If the application provides an IdentityStore, make sure that it returns valid UniqueId in CredentialValidationResult.

JAVAEESEC_CDI_WARNING_NO_IDENTITY_STORE_HANDLER=CWWKS1930W: IdentityStoreHandler bean is not found. Use a User Registry which is defined by server.xml. IdentityStoreHandler bean is created when there is at least one IdentityStore bean. If the application intends to use an IdentityStore, make sure that it is configured properly. 
JAVAEESEC_CDI_WARNING_NO_IDENTITY_STORE_HANDLER.explanation=IdentityStoreHandler bean is not found. If the application intends to use an IdentityStore, make sure that it is configured properly. IdentityStoreHandler bean is created when there is at least one IdentityStore bean.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_WARNING_NO_IDENTITY_STORE_HANDLER.useraction=If the application intends to use an IdentityStore, make sure that it is configured properly.

JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_LOGIN_CONFIG_EXISTS=CWWKS1931E: The application deployment was failed because login-config element is found in web.xml of application {0} module {1}. Make sure removing login-config element from web.xml in order to enable HttpAuthenticationMechanism annotation.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_LOGIN_CONFIG_EXISTS.explanation=The application deployment was failed because login-config element is found in web.xml. This is an error condition.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_ERROR_LOGIN_CONFIG_EXISTS.useraction=Make sure removing login-config element from web.xml in order to enable HttpAuthenticationMechanism annotation.

JAVAEESEC_CDI_INFO_NO_HTTPAUTHMECH=CWWKS1932I: The HttpAuthenticationMechanism bean was not found in the module {0}, the original login mechanism will be used.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_INFO_NO_HTTPAUTHMECH.explanation=This is the information that the deployed application does not bundle or activate HttpAuthenticationMechansim bean.
JAVAEESEC_CDI_INFO_NO_HTTPAUTHMECH.useraction=No action is requried if the application does not bundle or annotate for enabling HttpAuthenticationMechanism bean. Or make surse that the application is configured properly.

JAVAEESEC_CDI_WARNING_NO_REALM_NAME=CWWKS1933W: The realm name for the basic authentication is not set, the value defaultRealm is being used.
