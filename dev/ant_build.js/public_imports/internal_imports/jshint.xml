<project name="jshint">

  <!-- Ant Task: https://github.com/philmander/ant-jshint
       jshint: http://www.jshint.com
       Ant task is deprecated, so we must move to a supported platform.
       Rhino would probably be easier/safer since it's Java based so it will run everywhere.
       However, since node.js is javascript based, it tends to perform better than Rhino,
       but since the ant (java) version of jshint ran in 2-10 seconds, I don't think that's an issue. -->
