   - The nature of the boolean options has been inverted--beware!
     - `bitwise` now enables the use of bitwise operators.
     - `newcap` now means “ignore capitalisation of constructors”
     - `plusplus` now means “incr” and “decr” operators are tolerated.

     - `undef` now means you can declare variables out of order.
     - `white` now means acceptance of non-compliant whitespace.
   - New options:
     - `sloppy`, which is the inverse of `strict`.
     - `confusion`, allows inconsistent types.
     - `vars`, to tolerate multiple `var` declarations per function (replaces `onevar`).
     - `eqeq`, to tolerate "==" and "!=".
     - `node`, to predefine node.js globals.
     - `properties`, to require declaration of all properties.
     - `unparam`, to allow unused parameters.
