dojo 1.12.11 upgrade
- downloaded dojo-release-1.12.11-src.zip from https://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.12.11/
- removed extra top directory dojo-release-1.12.11 and re-zipped it back as dojo-1.12.11.zip
- idx 1.5.2.6 needed to be updated to use 1.12.11 instead of 1.12.9; all that was necessary was a simple version swap in the files to point to 1.12.11 and then rezipped the changes.
