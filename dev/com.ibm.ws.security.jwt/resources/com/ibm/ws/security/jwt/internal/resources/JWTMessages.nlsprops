JWT_TOKEN_BEFORE_NBF.explanation=The JWT has a 'nbf' (not-before) claim that specifies a time when the token becomes valid. The current time is before the 'nbf' time, so the token is not yet valid.
JWT_TOKEN_BEFORE_NBF.useraction=Wait until after the time specified by the 'nbf' claim before using this token, or obtain a new token with a 'nbf' claim set to a time before the current time. Synchronize the clock times between the token issuer and the consumer, or increase the clock skew in your JWT configuration.

# 0=Signature algorithm required for signing (e.g. RS256)
JWT_MISSING_KEY=CWWKS6029E: The JSON Web Token (JWT) cannot be validated because a signing key cannot be found. The configured signature algorithm [{0}] requires a key to validate the token.
JWT_MISSING_KEY.explanation=If using the HS256 signature algorithm, a shared key might not be specified in your JWT consumer configuration, or an empty value is specified. If using the RS256 signature algorithm, the key store service might not be available, or a key cannot be found within the truststore that matches the trusted alias specified by the JWT consumer configuration.
JWT_MISSING_KEY.useraction=Check the server logs for any additional error messages that explain why a key cannot be found. If using the HS256 signature algorithm, ensure that a shared key is specified in your JWT consumer configuration.

# Intended to be a child of JWT_ERROR_GETTING_PUBLIC_KEY
JWT_SIGNER_CERT_AMBIGUOUS=CWWKS6047E: Cannot determine which signer certificate in the truststore to use. Add the 'trustedAlias' attribute to the JWT consumer configuration or the 'keyName' attribute to the MP-JWT configuration.
JWT_SIGNER_CERT_AMBIGUOUS.explanation=Multiple signer certificates were found in the configured truststore. When there are multiple certificates in the truststore, the 'trustedAlias' attribute must be specified in the JWT consumer configuration or the 'keyName' attribute must be specified in the MP-JWT configuration to establish which certificate to use.

# 0=Issuer claim of the token, 1=JWT configuration ID
JWT_TRUSTED_ISSUERS_NULL=CWWKS6052E: The issuer [{0}] of the provided JSON Web Token (JWT) is not trusted because the JWT configuration [{1}] does not specify any trusted issuers.
JWT_TRUSTED_ISSUERS_NULL.explanation=The server configuration specifies which issuers are trusted for validating JWTs. The JWT configuration does not specify any trusted issuers, so the token cannot be validated.
JWT_TRUSTED_ISSUERS_NULL.useraction=Ensure that the JWT configuration that is specified in the message defines at least one trusted issuer. Ensure that the issuer of the JWT matches one of the trusted issuers specified in your JWT configuration.

SECURITY.JWT.ERROR.WRONG.HTTP.SCHEME=CWWKS6052E: HTTP scheme is used at the specified endpoint: {0}, HTTPS is required.
SECURITY.JWT.ERROR.WRONG.HTTP.SCHEME.explanation=The specified endpoint requires HTTPS, but HTTP was used in the request URL.

# 0=Signature algorithm from MP Config properties, 1=Default algorithm that will be used
MP_CONFIG_PUBLIC_KEY_ALG_NOT_SUPPORTED=CWWKS6053W: The [{0}] signature algorithm that is specified by the MicroProfile Config properties is not supported. The [{1}] signature algorithm will be used.
MP_CONFIG_PUBLIC_KEY_ALG_NOT_SUPPORTED.explanation=Only a certain set of RSA, Elliptical Curve, and HMAC signature algorithms are supported. The signature algorithm that is specified by the MicroProfile Config properties is not one of the supported signature algorithms.
MP_CONFIG_PUBLIC_KEY_ALG_NOT_SUPPORTED.useraction=Specify a supported signature algorithm in the MicroProfile Config properties. Supported signature algorithms include ES256, ES384, ES512, RS256, RS384, RS512, HS256, HS384, and HS512.

# Do not translate "JSON Web Token", "AMR", "JWT"
# 0=AMR claim of the token, 1=JWT configuration ID, 2=AMR specified in server configuration
JWT_AMR_CLAIM_NOT_VALID=CWWKS6054E: The AMR [{0}] of the provided JSON web token (JWT) is not listed as a trusted AMR in the [{1}] JWT configuration. The trusted AMR are [{2}].
JWT_AMR_CLAIM_NOT_VALID.explanation=The server configuration specifies which AMR are trusted when validating JWTs. The provided token is not intended for a trusted AMR, so the token cannot be validated.
JWT_AMR_CLAIM_NOT_VALID.useraction=Obtain a new token for one of the trusted AMR specified in your JWT configuration, or add the AMR specified in the message as a trusted AMR in your JWT configuration.

# 0=JWT configuration ID, 1=Signature algorithm configured in server.xml, 2=Signature algorithm that will be used by default
BETA_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM_USED=CWWKS6055W: The [{0}] configuration specifies the {1} signature algorithm, but that algorithm is only available in the beta edition. The {2} signature algorithm is used instead.
BETA_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM_USED.explanation=Support for the signature algorithm that is specified in the message might be incomplete, so the signature algorithm can be used only in the beta edition.
BETA_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM_USED.useraction=Configure a signature algorithm that is supported, or use the beta edition of this product to use the signature algorithm that is specified in the message.

# 0=Key management algorithm, 1=List of supported key management algorithms

UNSUPPORTED_CONTENT_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM.useraction=Verify that the provided content encryption algorithm matches one of the supported algorithms.

# Do not translate "JSON Web Encryption", "JWE", "Content Encryption Key"
# 0=Builder config ID
KEY_MANAGEMENT_KEY_MISSING=CWWKS6058W: The [{0}] JWT builder cannot create JSON Web Encryption (JWE) tokens because a key management key is not provided.
KEY_MANAGEMENT_KEY_MISSING.explanation=A key management key is a key that is used to encrypt the Content Encryption Key of a JWE token. A key must be specified so the JWT builder can create JWE tokens.
KEY_MANAGEMENT_KEY_MISSING.useraction=Verify that a key is provided to the builder API if the builder should create JWE tokens.

# 0=Builder config ID, 1=keyManagementKeyAlias, 2=keyManagementKeyAlgorithm, 3=contentEncryptionAlgorithm
KEY_MANAGEMENT_KEY_ALIAS_MISSING=CWWKS6059W: The [{0}] JWT builder configuration is missing the {1} attribute, so it cannot create JSON Web Encryption (JWE) tokens. Either configure the specified attribute or remove the {2} and {3} attributes.
KEY_MANAGEMENT_KEY_ALIAS_MISSING.explanation=The key management alias refers to a key that is used to encrypt the Content Encryption Key of a JWE token. A key alias must be specified so the JWT builder can create JWE tokens.
KEY_MANAGEMENT_KEY_ALIAS_MISSING.useraction=If the JWT builder should create JWE tokens, configure the key management alias attribute. If the JWT builder does not need to create JWE tokens, remove the other attributes that are mentioned in the message.

# 0=Builder config ID, 1=Exception message
ERROR_BUILDING_SIGNED_JWE=CWWKS6060E: The [{0}] JWT builder cannot create a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) token. {1}
