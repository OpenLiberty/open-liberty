  Issues on GitHub are only related to problems of Swagger-UI itself. We'll try
  to offer support here for your use case, but we can't offer help with projects
  that use Swagger-UI indirectly, like Springfox or swagger-node.

  Likewise, we can't accept bugs in the Swagger/OpenAPI specifications
  themselves, or anything that violates the specifications.
