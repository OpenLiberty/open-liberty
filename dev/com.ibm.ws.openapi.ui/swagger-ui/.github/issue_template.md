Thanks for filing an issue ðŸ˜„ ! Before you submit, please read the following:

Search open/closed issues before submitting since someone might have asked the same thing before!

Issues on GitHub are only related to problems of Swagger-UI itself. We'll try to offer support
here for your use case, but we can't offer help with projects that use Swagger-UI indirectly,
like Springfox or swagger-node.

Likewise, we can't accept features or bugs in the Swagger/OpenAPI specifications themselves,
or anything that violates the specifications.

  If you aren't sure what Swagger-UI version, see this guide: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/version-detection.md
