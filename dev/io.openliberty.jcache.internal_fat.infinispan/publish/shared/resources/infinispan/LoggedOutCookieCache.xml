    For testing we use a local cache to avoid errors / warnings since we run
    the Infinispan server in a remote Docker container. These issues result
    in a 6-7x performance degradation in the test (even though they still passed).
    
    A customer would probably want to use a distributed, replicated or scattered cache.
