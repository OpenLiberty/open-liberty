# EJB Container TimerService

timerService=EJB Timer Service
timerService.desc=Defines the behavior of the EJB timer service.

lateTimerThreshold=Late timer warning threshold
lateTimerThreshold.desc=Number of minutes after the scheduled expiration of a timer that the start of the timer will be considered late. When a timer does start late, a warning message will be logged indicating that the timer has started later than scheduled. The default threshold is 5 minutes and a value of 0 minutes turns off the warning message feature.

nonPersistentRetryInterval=Time interval between retries
nonPersistentRetryInterval.desc=When a non-persistent timer expires, the timeout callback method is called. If the transaction for this callback method fails or is rolled back, the container must retry the timer. The first retry attempt occurs immediately, and subsequent retry attempts are delayed by the number of seconds specified. If the value is set to 0, then all retries occur immediately. If you do not specify a value, the default interval is 300 seconds.

nonPersistentMaxRetries=Maximum number of retries
nonPersistentMaxRetries.desc=When a non-persistent timer expires, the timeout callback method is called. This setting controls how many times the EJB container attempts to retry the timer. If the transaction for this callback method fails or is rolled back, the EJB container must retry the timer at least once. The default value is -1, which means the EJB container retries infinitely until the timer is successful. If the value is set to 0, the EJB container does not retry the timer, however, this results in behavior that is not compliant with the EJB specification.

persistentExecutorRef=EJB Persistent Timers Scheduled Executor
persistentExecutorRef$Ref=EJB persistent timers executor reference
persistentExecutorRef.desc=Schedules and runs EJB persistent timer tasks.
