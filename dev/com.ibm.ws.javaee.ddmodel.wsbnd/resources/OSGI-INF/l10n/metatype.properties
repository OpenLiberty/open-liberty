security-constraint.name=Security Constraint
login-config.desc=A login configuration attribute is used to configure the authentication method and realm name, and takes effect only for the EJB-based web services in a JAR file. If the same attribute is specified in the deployment descriptor file, the value from the deployment descriptor is used. 
login-config.name=Login
security-role.desc=A security role attribute contains the definition of a security role. It only works as complementary configuration to the deployment descriptors or annotations in web applications.
security-role.name=Security Role
namespace.desc=The namespace attribute is used to specify the namespace of the web services port. The binding is applied to the port that has the same name and namespace. Otherwise, the binding is applied to the port that has the same name.

username.desc=The user name attribute is used to specify the user name for basic authentication.
username.name=User Name
username.name$Ref=User name
password.desc=The password attribute is used to specify the password for basic authentication. The password can be encoded.
password.name=Password
ssl-ref.desc= The SSL reference attribute refers to an ssl element defined in the server.xml file. If the attribute is not specified but the server supports transport level security the service client uses the default SSL configuration.
ssl-ref.name=SSL reference
key-alias.desc=The key alias attribute is used to specify the alias of a client certificate. If the attribute is not specified and the web service provider supports the client certificate then the first certificate in the keystore is used as the value of this attribute. The attribute can also override the clientKeyAlias attribute that is defined in the ssl element of the server.xml file.
