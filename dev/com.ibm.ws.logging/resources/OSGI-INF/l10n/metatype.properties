logging.properties=Logging
logging.properties.desc=Controls the capture and output of log and trace messages.

#
# File size / max files
#
max.file.size=Maximum log file size
max.file.size.desc=Maximum size of a log file, in megabytes, before being rolled over; a value of 0 means no limit.

max.files=Maximum log files
max.files.desc=Maximum number of log files that will be kept, before the oldest file is removed; a value of 0 means no limit.
#
# File name
#
log.directory=Log directory
log.directory.desc=Location of the directory for log files. The default value is ${server.output.dir}/logs.

message.file.name=Message file name
message.file.name.desc=Name of the file to which message output will be written relative to the configured log directory. The default value is messages.log.

trace.file.name=Trace file name
trace.file.name.desc=Name of the file to which trace output will be written relative to the configured log directory. The default value is trace.log.
#
# Console log level
#
console.level=Console log level
console.level.desc=The logging level used to filter messages written to system streams. The default value is audit.
console.level.info=Info, audit, and warning messages will be written to the system output stream. Error messages will be written to the system error stream.
console.level.audit=Audit and warning messages will be written to the system output stream. Error messages will be written to the system error stream.
console.level.warning=Warning messages will be written to the system output stream. Error messages will be written to the system error stream.
console.level.error=Error messages will be written to the system error stream.
console.level.off=No server output will be written to system streams.  Only JVM output will be written to system streams.

console.copySystemStreams=Copy System.out and System.err to system streams
console.copySystemStreams.desc=If true, write System.out to the system output stream and System.err to the system error stream. \
If false, System.out and System.err will write to configured logs like messages.log or trace.log, but not to the system streams. \
The default value is true.
#
# Trace specification and format
#
trace.specification=Trace specification
trace.specification.desc=A trace specification that conforms to the trace specification grammar and specifies the initial state \
for various trace components. An empty value is allowed and treated as 'disable all trace'. Any component that is not specified \
is initialized to a default state of *=info.

trace.format=Trace format
trace.format.desc= This format is used for the trace log.
trace.basic=Use the basic trace format.
trace.enhanced=Use the enhanced basic trace format.
trace.advanced=Use the advanced trace format.

isoDateFormat=Use the ISO 8601 date format
isoDateFormat.desc=If this attribute is set to true, log entries in the messages.log, trace.log, and FFDC log files will use the ISO 8601 date and time format. The default value is false.

filter.sensitive=Suppress sensitive trace
filter.sensitive.desc=The server trace can expose sensitive data when tracing untyped data, such as bytes received over a network connection. \
If true, prevent potentially sensitive information from being exposed in log and trace files. The default value is false.

hide.messages=Messages to be hidden
hide.messages.desc=The list of messages, separated by a comma, that are configured to be hidden from the console.log and message.log files. If the messages are configured to be hidden, then they are redirected to the trace.log file.
