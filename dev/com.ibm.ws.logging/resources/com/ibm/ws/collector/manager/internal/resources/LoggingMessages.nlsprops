HANDLER_STARTED_TO_LOSE_EVENTS_WARNING=TRAS0120W: The collector manager has detected that handler {0} has lost {1} events from source {2} since the handler started.
HANDLER_STARTED_TO_LOSE_EVENTS_WARNING.explanation=Handler loses events when it is not able to consume the events at the rate at which they are being produced by a source. The collector manager has sufficient large internal buffers to accommodate the slow consumption of events by a handler. However, a source that produces a large volume of events ends up overwriting these buffers, which means events might be lost before the handler could consume them.
HANDLER_STARTED_TO_LOSE_EVENTS_WARNING.useraction=No user action.
