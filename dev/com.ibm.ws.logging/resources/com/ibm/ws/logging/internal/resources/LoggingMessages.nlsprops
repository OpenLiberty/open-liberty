# Informational message telling the user the trace state has changed.
MSG_TRACE_STATE_CHANGED=TRAS0018I: The trace state has been changed. The new trace state is {0}.

# Warning message telling the user that the rename operation filed while rolling a log file over.
MSG_ROLLOVER_RENAME_FAILED=TRAS0031W: Unable to rename file {0} to {1} during log file rollover. Attempting to copy file contents.
MSG_ROLLOVER_RENAME_FAILED.explanation=Failed to rename the file indicated.  The most likely cause is that another process or thread is accessing the log file. WebSphere will try to complete the rollover operation by copying the contents of the log file - this process is slower, and all threads making attempting to log will be halted during this process.
MSG_ROLLOVER_RENAME_FAILED.useraction=Determine the cause of the rename failure and resolve it - this may involve shutting down other processes that are accessing the same log file.

UNKNOWN_TRACE_SPEC=TRAS0040I: The configured trace state included the following specifications that do not match any loggers currently registered in the server: {0} Ignore this message if the trace specifications {0} are valid.
UNKNOWN_TRACE_SPEC.explanation=Loggers are registered in the server when the code that creates them is first used. The system has detected that certain trace specifications refer to loggers that have not been registered in the server. The configured trace specifications may be valid for loggers that are not yet registered, or they could have been typed incorrectly. This check is performed each time the trace specification is updated on a running server.
UNKNOWN_TRACE_SPEC.useraction=Ensure that the trace specification has been configured correctly. If there are no mistakes in the trace specification string, no action is required.
