### SSL channel is using CHFW bundle ids, values 0800-0899

invalid.security.properties=CWWKO0800E: The SSL channel cannot be started due to the following incorrect settings:\n {0}
invalid.security.properties.explanation=One or more settings for security in the SSL channel were not valid.
invalid.security.properties.useraction=The SSL channel security settings should be modified to the correct values.

handshake.failure=CWWKO0801E: The SSL connection cannot be initialized from the {1} host and {2} port on the remote client to the {3} host and {4} port on the local server. Exception: {0}
handshake.failure.explanation=A new connection failed to complete a successful secure handshake. The most common reason is that the client sent an unencrypted message to a secure port. Another common reason is that an SSL certificate expired.
handshake.failure.useraction=If the client sent an unencrypted message to a secure port, configure the client to use SSL, or to connect to a port on the application server that does not require SSL. Alternatively, check whether an SSL certificate expired. If it has, replace the expired SSL certificate with an unexpired one.

init.failure=CWWKO0802E: Unable to initialize SSL bundle. Exception is {0}.
init.failure.explanation=An error was encountered while attempting to initialize the SSL bundle. This is likely due to a dependency failure.
init.failure.useraction=Review the process logs for information on what failed to start.

DEFAULT_OPTIONS_ERROR=CWWKO0803E: Unable to create default SSL channel configuration. Exception is {0}.
DEFAULT_OPTIONS_ERROR.explanation=An error was encountered while creating the default configuration for SSL channnels.
DEFAULT_OPTIONS_ERROR.useraction=Review the exception for information on how the creation failed.

handshake.failure.stop.logging=CWWKO0804I: The maximum number of SSL handshake failures to log has been reached. These messages will no longer be logged.
handshake.failure.stop.logging.explanation=The number of SSL handshake failures that are logged are limited to avoid excessive log entries.
handshake.failure.stop.logging.useraction=No action is required.
