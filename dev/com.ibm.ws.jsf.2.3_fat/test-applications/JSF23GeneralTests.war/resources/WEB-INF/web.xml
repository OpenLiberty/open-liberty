  <!-- I removed the FacesServlet definition and mapping here as MyFaces will map one
  for us if it is not defined under certain circumstances. Since this application has a faces-config.xml 
  a FacesServlet will be mapped. For JSF 2.3 the *.xhtml mapping was added. The tests that use
  this application should drive requests using the mapping. For instance: index.xhtml. To disable
  the *.xhtml mapping the javax.faces.DISABLE_FACESSERVLET_TO_XHTML context parameter can be enabled.
  A test for the javax.faces.DISABLE_FACESSERVLET_TO_XHTML parameter is in JSF23DisableFacesServletToXhtml.war. -->
