# Some of the messages in this file are processed as
# "java.text.MessageFormat" patterns and so use the apostrophe "'" and
# open brace "{" as special characters.
#
# If you are using the IBMJDK21 markup table to translate this file,
# type apostrophe characters as you wish them to appear to the user.
# The translation tools will automatically handle whether one or two
# apostrophes characters are required when the translated file is
# exported. See the following page for more details:

#
# If you are using the IBMJDK11 markup table or are a developer working
# with this file in a text editor, use the following rules for
# apostrophe characters:
#  a) If there are inserts in the message, for example "{0}", then
#     type two apostrophe characters, that is "''".
#  b) If there are no inserts, then just type a single apostrophe.
# Examples: 
#  a) message.xml.parserError.prefix=UDUT0036E: Erreur de l''analyseur syntaxique : {0} 
#  b) error.getAuthInfoFailed=UDUT0078E: Impossible d'obtenir authinfo.
