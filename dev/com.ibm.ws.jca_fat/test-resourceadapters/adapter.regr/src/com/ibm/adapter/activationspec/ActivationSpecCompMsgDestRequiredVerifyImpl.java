//This class has a misleading name and a misleading extension.
//
//This classes only reason for existance is to be a storage mechanism for data...it has no other purpose.
//In other words, this class could be replaced by writing to a flat file, or writing to a database, or any
//other mechanism that we can use to persist data.  The only reason we chose this class is that is the easier
//way to persist data...its simply a collection of static variables, with getter() and setter() methods for dealing
//with those variables.
//
//The class contains the phrase 'ActiationSpec' in its name, but its not used as an activation spec because
//its not called out the ra.xml file.
//
//It extends something with extends the Java ActivationSpec interface, so technically it is an activationSpec,
//but since its not being *used* as one, there is no reason to make it extend this interface, and it could be
//changed to stop extending this interface without causing any harm.
