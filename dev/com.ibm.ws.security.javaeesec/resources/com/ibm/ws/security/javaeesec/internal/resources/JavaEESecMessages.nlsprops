JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_IDENTITYSTORES=CWWKS1910E: IdentityStore object was not found. Make sure that at least one IdentityStore is defined by annotation in the application.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_IDENTITYSTORES.explanation=IdentityStore object was not found. It is required for the authentication and authorization.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_IDENTITYSTORES.useraction=Make sure that the application is properly annotated in order to enable at least one IdentityStore.

JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_VALIDATION=CWWKS1911E: No IdentityStore object supports the user validation. Make sure that at least one IdentityStore supports the user validation.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_VALIDATION.explanation=None of the IdentityStore object supports the user validation, therefore the security code does not authenticate the user.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_VALIDATION.useraction=Make sure that at least one IdentityStore supports the user validation.

JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_HAM=CWWKS1912E: The HttpAuthenticationMechanism object for the {0} module in the {1} application was not found. Make sure that the module contains a HttpAuthenticationMechanism object.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_HAM.explanation=HttpAuthenticationMechanism object cannot be identified for authentication. It could be there is no object, or multiple objects which corresponds the specified condition. Make sure that there is one HttpAuthenticationMechanism in the application.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_HAM.useraction=Make sure that there is one HttpAuthenticationMechanism in the application.

JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_MODULE_PROPS=CWWKS1913E: The ModuleProperties object for authenticating the {0} application cannot be found, likely because the application does not contain a HttpAuthenticationMechanism object. Make sure that one HttpAuthenticationMechanism object is defined for each module.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_MODULE_PROPS.explanation=The ModuleProperties object, which is required to authenticate the application, cannot be identified. This error typically results from a HttpAuthenticationMechanism object not being defined in the application.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_NO_MODULE_PROPS.useraction=Make sure that each module in the application contains a HttpAuthenticationMechanism object.

JAVAEESEC_WARNING_NO_REALM_NAME=CWWKS1914W: The realm name for the basic authentication is not set, the value defaultRealm is being used.
JAVAEESEC_WARNING_NO_REALM_NAME.explanation=The realm name for the basic authentication is not set, the default value defaultRealm is being used.
JAVAEESEC_WARNING_NO_REALM_NAME.useraction=If the realm name needs to be set, please set it by using BasicAuthenticationMechanismDefinition annotation in the application.

JAVAEESEC_ERROR_MULTIPLE_HTTPAUTHMECHS=CWWKS1915E: The deployment for the {0} module in the {1} application failed because multiple HttpAuthenticationMechanism implementation are found. The list of classes is {2}. Most likely, this is an application packaging issue. Make sure that there is only one HttpAuthenticationMechanism implementation in each module.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_MULTIPLE_HTTPAUTHMECHS.explanation=The application deployment failed because more than one HttpAuthenticationMechanism implementation are found. This condition is not allowed.
JAVAEESEC_ERROR_MULTIPLE_HTTPAUTHMECHS.useraction=Make sure that there is only one HttpAuthenticationMechanism implementation for each module in the application.
