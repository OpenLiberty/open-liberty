The persistence design is as follows:

IF the COLLECTIVE persistence is available
THEN load from COLLECTIVE persistence
	IF persisted in COLLECTIVE
	THEN return persisted object
	ELSE load from FILE persistence
		IF persisted in FILE
		THEN store persisted FILE object to COLLECTIVE, return object
		ELSE create default object, store persisted FILE object to COLLECTIVE, return object 
ELSE load from FILE persistence
	IF persisted in FILE
	THEN return object
	ELSE create default object, return object
