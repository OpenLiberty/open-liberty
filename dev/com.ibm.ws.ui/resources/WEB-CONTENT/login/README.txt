This 'login' resources directory will store all of the required files for rendering
the login and logout pages. These resources must be unprotected (as specified in the
web.xml) so that they can be served to the browser during a login flow.

The contents of this directory (when packaged) will only contain:
login-init.js, *.css, *.html and images/
