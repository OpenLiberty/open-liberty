   * The Below code is used to get around the fact that our tools are currently being opened as iframes 
   * (we will likely want to change this since it causes complications) and an iFrame has its own hash 
   * (each window has its own hash, and an iframe is its own window).  dojo/hash reads the current window's
   * hash, so it doesn't work for us in the tool.  So instead, we subscribe to hashchange notifications here,
   * and if a tool iframe is present, we update its hash.  This allows us to rely on dojo/hash for reading 
   * the hash from within the tool, but setting it still has to be done 'manually' using top.location.hash
