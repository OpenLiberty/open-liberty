CWPKI2055W.explanation=Frequent certificate requests can have a negative impact on server performance. The number of requests can also exceed the number allowed by the certificate authority.
CWPKI2055W.useraction=To avoid this warning message, set the renewBeforeExpiration property in the server configuration to a longer duration. To use the default setting, remove the renewBeforeExpiration property from the server configuration.

CWPKI2056W=CWPKI2056W: The validity period of the certificate with {0} serial number is shorter than the {1} minimum renew time. The validity period of the certification is {2}. The renewBeforeExpiration property is reset to {3}.
CWPKI2056W.explanation=The validity period is shorter than the minimum renew time. The certificate expires before a new certificate is requested.
