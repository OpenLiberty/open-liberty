CWPKI2055W=CWPKI2055W: The renewBeforeExpiration property is set to a short amount of time. The ACME service makes frequent requests for a new certificate. The renewBeforeExpiration property is {0}.
CWPKI2055W.explanation=Frequent certificate requests can have a negative impact on server performance. The number of requests can also exceed the number allowed by the certificate authority.
CWPKI2055W.useraction=To avoid this warning message, set the renewBeforeExpiration property in the server configuration to a longer duration. To use the default setting, remove the renewBeforeExpiration property from the server configuration.

CWPKI2056W=CWPKI2056W: The validity period of the certificate with {0} serial number is shorter than the {1} minimum renew time. The validity period of the certification is {2}. The renewBeforeExpiration property is reset to {3}.
CWPKI2056W.explanation=The validity period is shorter than the minimum renew time. The certificate expires before a new certificate is requested.
CWPKI2056W.useraction=To avoid certificate expiration, request a certificate with a longer validity period. If the certificate authority supports a custom validity period, set the validFor property in the server configuration.

CWPKI2057E=CWPKI2057E: Certificate revocation status checking did not create a Java certificate path validation tool to validate the certificate. The error is ''{0}''.
CWPKI2057E.explanation=The certificate revocation checker needs to build a Java certificate path validation tool to check OCSP and CRLs revocation status.

CWPKI2061E.explanation=The CRL distribution points were not retrieved.
CWPKI2061E.useraction=Ensure that the certificate is a valid X.509 certificate. If it is not valid, request a new certificate.

CWPKI2062E=CWPKI2062E: The {0} OCSP responder URL defined in the server configuration is not a valid URI. If defined, it must be a valid URI to override the OSCP responder URL contained in the certificate.

CWPKI2065W.useraction=Review the error message for details on the failure.

CWPKI2066E=CWPKI2066E: The ACME service failed to automatically renew the certificate with the {0} serial number. The certificate is revoked. The request is scheduled to try again in {1}. The renew request error is ''{2}''.
CWPKI2066E.explanation=The ACME service tried to renew a certificate but encountered an error. The ACME service continues to request a new certificate until a new certificate is issued. SSL and TLS requests fail until a new certificate request is successful.
CWPKI2066E.useraction=Review the error message for details on the failure. 

CWPKI2067I=CWPKI2067I: The certificate with the {0} serial number is revoked. The ACME service requests a new certificate from the ACME certificate authority at the {1} URI.
CWPKI2067I.explanation=When the ACME service detects that the certificate is revoked, it automatically requests a new certificate.
CWPKI2067I.useraction=No action is required.

CWPKI2068W=CWPKI2068W: The ACME service automatic certificate checking failed to check if the certificate with the {0} serial number is expiring or revoked. The check is scheduled to try again in {1}. The error is ''{2}''.
CWPKI2068W.explanation=The ACME service started checking if the certificate is expiring or revoked, but failed.
CWPKI2068W.useraction=Review the error message for details on the failure. Review the certificate status using the ACME REST interface. If the certificate needs to be renewed, use the ACME REST interface to request a new certificate.

CWPKI2069I=CWPKI2069I: The ACME service automatic certificate checking is disabled. Expiring or revoked certificates are not automatically renewed.
CWPKI2069I.explanation=The ACME service does not check for expiring or revoked certificates on an automated schedule. If the certificate expires or is revoked, SSL and TLS requests cannot complete unless the server is restarted or the REST interface is used to renew the certificate.
CWPKI2069I.useraction=No action is required. To enable automatic certificate checking, update the certCheckerSchedule property in the server configuration to a value greater than 0.

CWPKI2070W=CWPKI2070W: The certCheckerSchedule property was set to {0}, which is shorter than the minimum schedule time. The certCheckerSchedule property is reset to {1}.
CWPKI2070W.explanation=The value for the certCheckerSchedule property was below the minimum duration to check for expiring or revoked certificates and is reset to the minimum schedule time.
CWPKI2070W.useraction=To avoid this warning message, set the certCheckerSchedule property in the server configuration to a duration that is longer than the minimum schedule time. To use the default setting, remove the certCheckerSchedule property from the server configuration.

CWPKI2071W=CWPKI2071W: The certCheckerErrorSchedule property was set to {0}, which is shorter than the minimum schedule time. The certCheckerErrorSchedule property is reset to {1}.
CWPKI2071W.explanation=The value for the certCheckerErrorSchedule property was below the minimum duration to check for expiring or revoked certificates and is reset to the minimum schedule time.
CWPKI2071W.useraction=To avoid this warning message, set the certCheckerErrorSchedule property in the server configuration to a duration that is longer than the minimum schedule time. To use the default setting, remove the certCheckerErrorSchedule property from the server configuration.

CWPKI2072W=CWPKI2072W: The ACME service could not read or write the historical ACME file at {0}. The error is ''{1}''.
CWPKI2072W.explanation=The ACME service was unable to access the historical ACME file.
CWPKI2072W.useraction=Ensure that the historical ACME directory has read and write permissions.

CWPKI2073W=CWPKI2073W: No account contact was specified. It is recommended to set this property in server configuration. If a key is lost or the account is compromised, access to the account is lost.
CWPKI2073W.explanation=The value for the accountContact property was not specified in the server configuration.
CWPKI2073W.useraction=Set the accountContact property in server configuration.
