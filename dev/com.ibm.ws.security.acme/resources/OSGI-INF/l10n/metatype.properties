directoryURI=ACME server directory URI
directoryURI.desc=The URI to the ACME CA server's directory object.

domain=Domain name
domain.desc=A domain name to request a certificate for.

validFor=Valid for
validFor.desc=The duration of time that the certificate signing request specifies for the certificate to be valid. The default is defined by the ACME CA server.

subjectDN=Subject distinguished name
subjectDN.desc=Subject distinguished name (DN) to use for the certificate. The DN can include the following relative distinguished name (RDN) types: cn, c, st, l, o and ou. If the cn RDN type is defined, it must be one of the domains defined by the domain configuration element and it must be the first RDN in the DN. If the cn RDN type is not defined, the first domain defined by the domain configuration element is used as the cn RDN value.

challengeRetries=Challenge retries
challengeRetries.desc=The number of times to retry updating the challenge status before aborting the challenge.

challengeRetryWait=Challenge retry wait
challengeRetryWait.desc=The amount of time to wait before retrying to refresh the status of a challenge.

orderRetries=Order retries
orderRetries.desc=The number of times to retry updating the order status before aborting the order.

orderRetryWait=Order retry wait
orderRetryWait.desc=The amount of time to wait before retrying to refresh the status of an order.

accountContact=Account contact
accountContact.desc=A contact URL the ACME server can use to contact the client for issues related this the ACME account.

accountKeyFile=Account key file
accountKeyFile.desc=A path to the file containing a key identifier for a registered account on the ACME CA server. If the file does not exist, a new account is registered with the ACME CA server and the associated key is written to this file. Back this file up to maintain control of the account on the ACME CA server. 

domainKeyFile=Domain key file
domainKeyFile.desc=A path to the file containing a key identifier for a domain. If the file does not exist, a new key is generated and written to this file. Back this file up to maintain control of the domain. 

acmeTransportConfig=ACME transport configuration
acmeTransportConfig.desc=ACME transport layer configuration.

sslProtocol=SSL protocol
sslProtocol.desc=The SSL handshake protocol. Protocol values can be found in the documentation for the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) provider of the underlying JRE.  When using the IBM JRE the default value is SSL_TLSv2 and when using the Oracle JRE the default value is SSL.

trustStore=Truststore
trustStore.desc=A keystore that contains trusted certificate entries that are used by SSL for signing verification.

trustStorePassword=Truststore password
trustStorePassword.desc=The password that is used to load the truststore file. The value can be stored in clear text or encoded form. Use the securityUtility tool to encode the password.

trustStoreType=Truststore type
trustStoreType.desc=The keystore type for the truststore. Supported types are JKS, PKCS12 and JCEKS.
