# ACME configuration

acmeCA.config=ACME Certificate Authority
acmeCA.config.desc=Configuration for the ACME Certificate Authority.

directoryURI=ACME server directory URI
directoryURI.desc=The URI to the ACME CA server's directory object.

domain=Domain name
domain.desc=A domain name to request a certificate for.

validFor=Valid for
validFor.desc=The duration of time that the certificate signing request specifies for the certificate to be valid. The default is defined by the ACME CA server.

subjectDN=Subject distinguished name
subjectDN.desc=Subject distinguished name (DN) to use for the certificate. The DN can include the following relative distinguished name (RDN) types: cn, c, st, l, o and ou. If the cn RDN type is defined, it must be one of the domains defined by the domain configuration element and it must be the first RDN in the DN. If the cn RDN type is not defined, the first domain defined by the domain configuration element is used as the cn RDN value.

challengePollTimeout=Challenge poll timeout
challengePollTimeout.desc=The amount of time to spend polling the status of an ACME challenge before polling discontinues and treats the challenge as failed. A value of 0 indicates to poll indefinitely.

orderPollTimeout=Order poll timeout
orderPollTimeout.desc=The amount of time to spend polling the status of an ACME order before polling discontinues and treats the order as failed. A value of 0 indicates to poll indefinitely.

accountContact=Account contact
accountContact.desc=A contact URL the ACME server can use to contact the client for issues related this the ACME account.

accountKeyFile=Account key file
accountKeyFile.desc=A path to the file containing a key identifier for a registered account on the ACME CA server. If the file does not exist, a new account is registered with the ACME CA server and the associated key is written to this file. Back this file up to maintain control of the account on the ACME CA server. 

domainKeyFile=Domain key file
domainKeyFile.desc=A path to the file containing a key identifier for a domain. If the file does not exist, a new key is generated and written to this file. Back this file up to maintain control of the domain. 

acmeTransport=ACME Transport
acmeTransport.desc=ACME transport layer.
acmeTransport$Ref=ACME transport reference

sslProtocol=SSL protocol
sslProtocol.desc=The SSL handshake protocol. Protocol values can be found in the documentation for the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) provider of the underlying JRE.  When using the IBM JRE the default value is SSL_TLSv2 and when using the Oracle JRE the default value is SSL.

trustStore=Truststore
trustStore.desc=A keystore that contains trusted certificate entries that are used by SSL for signing verification.

trustStorePassword=Truststore password
trustStorePassword.desc=The password that is used to load the truststore file. The value can be stored in clear text or encoded form. Use the securityUtility tool to encode the password.

trustStoreType=Truststore type
trustStoreType.desc=The keystore type for the truststore. Supported types are JKS, PKCS12 and JCEKS.

renewBeforeExpiration=Renew time before expiration
renewBeforeExpiration.desc=Time period before the expiration date of the certificate to request a new certificate. For example, if the renewBeforeExpiration property is set to seven days, the ACME service requests a new certificate seven days before the expiration date of the current certificate. Setting the renewBeforeExpiration property to zero or a negative value disables automatic certificate renew requests.

acmeRevocationChecker=ACME Certificate Revocation Checker
acmeRevocationChecker.desc=Configuration for checking the revocation status of certificates with the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) or Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
acmeRevocationChecker$Ref=ACME certificate revocation checker reference

enabled=Certificate revocation checking enabled
enabled.desc=Verifies whether certificate revocation checking is enabled for the ACME CA service. The default is true.

ocspResponderUrl=OCSP responder URL
ocspResponderUrl.desc=Sets the URI that identifies the location of the OCSP responder. This setting overrides the ocsp.responderURL security property and any responder that is specified in the certificate Authority Information Access Extension.

preferCRLs=Prefer CRLs
preferCRLs.desc=By default, OCSP is the preferred mechanism for checking revocation status, with CRLs as the fallback mechanism. Switch the preference to CRLs with this option. 

disableFallback=No fallback
disableFallback.desc=Disable the certificate revocation status checker fallback mechanism. During certificate revocation status check, the default behavior is fallback and check by using the non-preferred mechanism (OCSP or CRLs). Default is false.

certCheckerSchedule=Certificate checker schedule
certCheckerSchedule.desc=Interval for the ACME CA service to check if the certificate is expiring or revoked. If the certificate is expiring or revoked, the ACME CA service issues a certificate renew request. If the first renew request fails, the certificate renew request continues according to the timing set by the certCheckerErrorSchedule attribute until a new certificate is received. Setting the certCheckerSchedule property to zero or a negative value disables automatic certificate renew requests.

certCheckerErrorSchedule=Certificate checker error schedule
certCheckerErrorSchedule.desc=Performs the same function as the certCheckerSchedule attribute, but on an alternate schedule. For example, the certCheckerErrorSchedule attribute can be set to a shorter interval than the certCheckerSchedule attribute, to increase the frequency of checks after a failed request. The interval from the certCheckerSchedule attribute is resumed after the certificate is renewed. 

disableMinRenewWindow=Disable minimum renew window
disableMinRenewWindow.desc=Enables immediate certificate renew requests by disabling the specified minimum amount of time between renew requests. The minimum renew time is 15 seconds.

disableRenewOnNewHistory=Disable certificate refresh if the ACME history file does not yet exist
disableRenewOnNewHistory.desc=Disables automatic certificate refresh when ACME creates the ACME history file.
