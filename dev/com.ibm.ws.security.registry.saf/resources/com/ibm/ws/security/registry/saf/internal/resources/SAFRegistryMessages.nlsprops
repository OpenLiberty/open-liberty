PENALTY_BOX_FALLBACK=CWWKS2930W: A SAF authentication attempt using authorized SAF services was rejected because the server is not authorized to access the APPL-ID {0}. Authentication will proceed using unauthorized SAF services.
PENALTY_BOX_FALLBACK.explanation=The server attempted to use authorized SAF services to perform authentication; however the attempt failed because the server does not have authority to access the indicated APPL-ID resource, according to the WLP z/OS System Security Access Domain (WZSSAD). The server will fall back to using unauthorized SAF services provided by Unix System Services to perform authentication.
PENALTY_BOX_FALLBACK.useraction=If using authorized SAF services is desired, grant the user associated with the server the proper authority to the APPL-ID resource in the WLP z/OS System Security Access Domain (WZSSAD). Refer to the infocenter for more information about the WZSSAD. If using authorized SAF services is not desired, configure the server to use the unauthorized SAF registry rather than the authorized SAF registry. Refer to the infocenter for details.

PENALTY_BOX_RECOVERY=CWWKS2931I: The server is now authorized to access the APPL-ID {0}. Authentication will proceed using authorized SAF services.
PENALTY_BOX_RECOVERY.explanation=A previous authentication attempt failed because the server was not authorized to access the indicated APPL-ID resource (see message CWWKS2930W); however the server is now authorized to access the APPL-ID. Further authentication attempts will proceed using authorized SAF services.
PENALTY_BOX_RECOVERY.useraction=None.

ACTIVATION_MESSAGE=CWWKS2932I: The {0} version of the SAF user registry is activated. Authentication will proceed using {0} native services.
ACTIVATION_MESSAGE.explanation=The message indicates which version of the SAF user registry is in use.  There are two versions: \
 (1) the unauthorized version, which uses unauthorized UNIX System Services such as __passwd; (2) the authorized version, which \
 uses authorized SAF services such as initACEE.  
ACTIVATION_MESSAGE.useraction=The server must have access to SAFCRED authorized resources and the WLP z/OS System Security Access Domain \
 in order to use the authorized version of the SAF registry.
 
DAEMON_LOGIN_ERROR=CWWKS2933E: The username and password could not be checked because the BPX.DAEMON profile is active, and the address space is not under program control.
DAEMON_LOGIN_ERROR.explanation=Using the unauthorized version of the SAF registry on a system where BPX.DAEMON is active requires that all libraries used by Liberty to be under program control. An alternative is to use the authorized version of the SAF registry.
DAEMON_LOGIN_ERROR.useraction=If the intent was to use the authorized version of the SAF registry, look for error messages earlier in the message.log file that might have prevented the authorized registry from starting. Otherwise consider disabling BPX.DAEMON profile or put all libraries under program control.

ENABLE_FAILOVER_MESSAGE=CWWKS2934E: The server is not permitted to use the authorized SAF registry.
ENABLE_FAILOVER_MESSAGE.explanation=The server is not permitted to use the authorized SAF registry. The value of enableFailover prevents the server from using the unauthorized SAF registry. All future authentication attempts will fail.
ENABLE_FAILOVER_MESSAGE.useraction=If the intent was for the server to use the authorized SAF registry, check that the angel process is running and that the server can access the necessary SAF profiles to use the authorized SAF registry. If the intent was for the server to use the unauthorized SAF registry, the enableFailover setting must be changed to true, which is the default value.

UNAUTH_INCLUDE_SAF=CWWKS2935W: The server attribute includeSafGroups is enabled but the server doesn't have access to the required authorized functions.
UNAUTH_INCLUDE_SAF.explanation=The attribute to get non-OMVS groups is enabled; however, the server does not have access to authorized functions and cannot get the SAF groups.
UNAUTH_INCLUDE_SAF.useraction=The user should enable authorized functions to access non OMVS groups.

SAF_AUTH_SERVICES_DISABLED_AND_FAILOVER=CWWKS2936I: Server initialization is in progress and SAF authorized services are currently unavailable. Look for a subsequent CWWKS2938I message on the availability of SAF authorized services. The server.xml file contains the safRegistry element with the attribute enableFailover set to true. This setting allows failover to unauthorized UNIX System Services if SAF authorized services remain unavailable.
SAF_AUTH_SERVICES_DISABLED_AND_FAILOVER.explanation=The server is in the process of determining whether SAF authorized services or unauthorized UNIX System Services will be used. Currently, SAF authorized services are unavailable. If they remain unavailable, failover to unauthorized UNIX System Services will occur. Failover occurs because, server.xml file contains the safRegistry element with the attribute enableFailover which either defaulted to true true or is explicitly set to true.
SAF_AUTH_SERVICES_DISABLED_AND_FAILOVER.useraction=Ignore this message if SAF authorized services are not configured. If SAF authorized services are configured, look for CWWKS2938I indicating that SAF authorized services are now available. If SAF authorized services are configured and CWWKS2938I is not found, look for error messages that describe the error. For more information, see the product documentation about enabling z/OS authorized services.

SAF_AUTH_SERVICES_DISABLED_NO_FAILOVER=CWWKS2937I: Server initialization is in progress and SAF authorized services are currently unavailable. Look for a subsequent CWWKS2938I message on the availability of SAF authorized services. The server.xml file contains the safRegistry element with the enableFailover attribute set to false. This setting prevents failover to unauthorized UNIX System Services if SAF authorized services remain unavailable.
SAF_AUTH_SERVICES_DISABLED_NO_FAILOVER.explanation=The server is in the process of determining whether SAF authorized services or unauthorized UNIX System Services will be used. Currently SAF authorized services are unavailable. If they remain unavailable, failover to unauthorized UNIX System Services will not occur. Failover will not occur because, server.xml file contains the safRegistry element with the enableFailover=false attribute.
SAF_AUTH_SERVICES_DISABLED_NO_FAILOVER.useraction=Ignore this message if message CWWKS2938I is found indicating SAF authorized services are available. If CWWKS2938I is not found, the configuration is invalid. To use the SAF user registry you must use either SAF authorized services or failover to unauthorized UNIX System Services via the enableFailover attribute. For more information, see the product documentation about enabling z/OS authorized services.

SAF_AUTH_SERVICES_ENABLED=CWWKS2938I: SAF authorized services are available, and the server.xml file contains the safRegistry element with the enableFailover={0} attribute. If SAF authorized services become unavailable when the enableFailover attribute is true, the SAF registry uses the unauthorized UNIX System Services. Otherwise, attempts to access protected resources will fail.
SAF_AUTH_SERVICES_ENABLED.explanation=SAF authorized services are available. If SAF authorized services become unavailable when the enableFailover attribute is true, the SAF registry uses the unauthorized UNIX System Services. Otherwise, attempts to access protected resources will fail.
SAF_AUTH_SERVICES_ENABLED.useraction=No action is required.
