# Translator Instructions:
#
# The messages to be translated are contained in key/text pairs and
# contains three parts:
#
# 1) A key (a text string) which is an identifier used by the code to
#    retrieve data.  This is required - and SHOULD NOT be translated.
# 2) A equals ("=") sign separating the key and text.  This is required.
# 3) A string containing data that will be displayed to
#    the user when running the application.  This is required and
#    SHOULD be translated.
#
# In short, each line in the resource array contains two strings.
# The SECOND quoted string on each line should be translated.
#
# Some of the strings to be translated contain special codes
# for data that will be inserted into the string when the string
# is displayed to the user.  For example, say you have the
# following string to translate:
#
#   This file was written by the IBM Administrator on {0,date}.
#
# {0,date} is a code that tells java to insert a parameter into
# this space when displaying it to the user.  In this case,
# the parameter that is inserted is a date.
#
# The 0 indicates that this is where the first parameter is
# inserted in the string.  There may be more than one parameter
# in any one string.  The 'date' tells java to format this
# parameter as a date.
#
# The {0,date} code should be placed at the appropriate position
# in the translated text.  Please note that the code in the
# translation must match exactly the code in the original
# string.
#
# The developer should describe in comments above the string to be
# translated each of the parameters so that you will be able to
# determine where the best location for each parameter in the
# translated string.
#
# Lines that begin with a pound sign (#) are comments and should not be
# translated.

OPENTRACING_NO_APPNAME_FOUND_IN_JNDI=CWMOT0000E: Lookup of the application name in JNDI did not return a value. A default name is used for Opentracing service name.
OPENTRACING_NO_APPNAME_FOUND_IN_JNDI.explanation=The feature provides the application name to the user supplied OpentracingTracerFactory implementation. The application name could not be retrieved by JNDI lookup of "java:app/AppName". A default service name was provided.
OPENTRACING_NO_APPNAME_FOUND_IN_JNDI.useraction=Determine why the application name is not available through JNDI lookup of "java:app/AppName".

OPENTRACING_COULD_NOT_CREATE_TRACER=CWMOT0001E: Invocation of user supplied OpentracingTracerFactory.newInstance(...) method failed with Exception. Message = {0}
OPENTRACING_COULD_NOT_CREATE_TRACER.explanation=The feature constructs Tracer implementations with a user provided OpentracingTracerFactory. The OpentracingTracerFactory.newInstance method returned an exception.
OPENTRACING_COULD_NOT_CREATE_TRACER.useraction=Determine why the user supplied OpentracingTracerFactory newInstance method returned an exception.

OPENTRACING_TRACERFACTORY_RETURNED_NULL=CWMOT0006E: Invocation of user supplied OpentracingTracerFactory.newInstance(...) method returned null
OPENTRACING_TRACERFACTORY_RETURNED_NULL.explanation=The feature constructs Tracer implementations with a user provided OpentracingTracerFactory. The OpentracingTracerFactory.newInstance method returned null.
OPENTRACING_TRACERFACTORY_RETURNED_NULL.useraction=Determine why the user supplied OpentracingTracerFactory newInstance method returned null.

OPENTRACING_NO_TRACERFACTORY=CWMOT0008E: OpenTracing cannot track JAX-RS requests because an OpentracingTracerFactory class was not provided.
OPENTRACING_NO_TRACERFACTORY.explanation=OpenTracing will not function properly because an OpentracingTracerFactory class was not provided. JAX-RS requests will execute normally, but they will not be tracked.
OPENTRACING_NO_TRACERFACTORY.useraction=For more information, see the documentation about how to enable OpenTracing distributed tracing.

temporary.CWMOT9999E=CWMOT9999E: An Opentracing API error has occurred: {0}
temporary.CWMOT9999E.explanation=An Opentracing API error has occurred that prevents normal operation.
temporary.CWMOT9999E.useraction=Review the FFDC logs and exception text to identify the problem.
